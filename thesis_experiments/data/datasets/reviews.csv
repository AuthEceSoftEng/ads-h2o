"rn433123219","NIKOS G","","29 reviews","Fairytale","1","2016-10-31","Well, what can I say about something so special and breathtaking. Wonderful experience that everyone should have in a lifetime. Be careful to book your tickets online at least one month before and wear comfortable shoes.You have to choose which time of the day you are going to visit It when you will make the booking. Best is from 8:30 to 14:00. It is best to enter not from the main entrance but from the other one in the opposite side. In order to do this, one day before, you have to take the tickets you have booked from the ticket office in Granada ( closes at 19:00) or from a certain bank's atm using the credit card you have made the payment. From this entrance is the most popular and important area, and you only have half hour to see it. All the other parts of the castles are free of hour restrictions.So if you finish with that, then you will not have to calculate the time all the time.Also, the que in this entrance is significant smaller. You must be there very eartly in the morning. It will take you at least 4 to 5 hours to see everything this magnificent monument has to offer.",8,"Fairytale.

Yes the palace and gardens are magnificent and deserving of their Unesco status, but since it is such a famous site it was ,when we visited, packed with huge groups of tourists. Our local guide arrived 25 minutes late, reducing our visit time to under 2 hours.....we had been promised 4 hours by our tour company...which was much more realistic to do the site justice....there is about just under 5km of walking. The end of the tour was a total shambles. The guide had left some of those who did not want to walk further on benches promising to collect then on return from the gardens. However he then abandoned the rest of the group and it was left to our tour company courier to get the group back to the main entrance. Unfortunately there was a muddle/error on the pick up point for our coach, with much unwelcome ""route marching"" The shop was closed at 16.00 hrs and no books were available to buy.

"rn421609943","bielinki","new york","22 reviews","Alhambra with children","1","2016-09-23","Alhambra with childrenThis review is broad and geared toward folks like us - a family of four, with an infant and a toddler. Let me start by saying that I read many reviews about the place and all the difficulties mentioned are either exaggerated or non-existent. Some people complained about the staff being rude. None of the sort. The staff around was helpful all along. I am fluent in Spanish but they still tried some English, which discredits some accounts about staff not bothering trying to answer English speaking visitors. Some reviewers went through some lengths to make the process of getting a ticket seem a formidable endeavor. It's simple: find the website (it's Ticketmaster). Choose the date you want. The Alhambra is divided into two sections, the Generalife (gardens) and the main palace complex itself. The admission to the general complex (the Generalife and around the palace) is divided into AM or PM visits. So you chose whether you want to visit in the morning or afternoon. As long you enter within your chosen part of the day (AM or PM) you can stay inside all the time you want. If you want to see the palace (Nasir palace) you must pick a specific time within the AM or PM portion that you already chose. The Alhambra opens at 8:30am , so if you chose the AM portion you can enter at 8:30am, and if you picked ""10AM"" to enter the Nasir palace then you have to be in line in front of the palace 10am the latest. I believe the ""AM"" portion goes from 8:30 to 1:30-2:00PM. Most of the bad reviews about the Alhambra come from one place: people not paying attention to instructions, which are in Spanish and English when you buy the tickets online. Children do not pay, however, a ticket similar to yours must be issued to each child and presented when requested. You should not toss your ticket in the trash as soon as you enter the complex: there are gates all over and they ask to check your ticket each time. Without the ticket you cannot enter the Nasir's palace and another building in the Generalife. Get yourself coordinates to the parking lot of the Alhambra - I think it's impossible to miss it if you are going to Alhambra by car. Parking lot number 1 is the closest but it's usually full even early am, but there is parking lot 2,3,4 etc and they are not more than a five minute walk to the entrance of the complex. It costs about 15-20 euros for the entire day to park. Do not fret about where/how you are going to print your tickets - you get them at the Alhambra. Once you buy your tickets online a reservation is created but there are no actual physical tickets. You print the tickets at the site : once you leave the parking lot, just as you face the main entrance of the complex the printing machines are all the way to the right, passing the big giftshop. There are many machines and it takes 30 seconds to print the tickets. The tickets can be printed ONLY on the day of the visit, not before. You either insert the credit card you used to buy the tickets online or type in the number of your reservation. There are some reviews complaining about expired credit cards not doing the job: well, it is true that the ticket reservations should be made well in advance (we visited early September and had bought the tickets a month earlier) and I understand that a credit card may expire in between, but an expired credit card is the same as if you were shoving a popsicle wrapping into the machine and expecting results - it's trash, do yourself a favor and smarten up. Besides, even if your credit card does not work you should have in front of you the number of the reservation. Tickets can be bought the same day at the Alhambra, but you have to be there early, I mean early (before 7am - a staff said 6am at certain times of the year), because it's a limited number and the demand is huge. A final point on the tickets: even though we bought the ticket one month ahead and there were hundreds of tickets available online (it tells you how many), the early admission options for the Nasir Palace (8:30, 9AM) were all already gone. That is because people know that it's best to visit it without a crowd. The main entrance leads directly to the Generalife, which is this gorgeous set of gardens and groves. The Nasir palace and the other set of structures are at least 15 minutes away on foot, depending on where you are in the Generalife - and the Generalife is not small at all. If are not in line at ""10am"" as per example above you will not be allowed into the palace complex, period. I agree with every single review that advises to not miss the Nasir palace - it's an absolute must. If you are going to Alhambra do your utmost to see it, even if it's the only section you visit (never mind the Generalife when compared to the main palace complex). Well, as I mentioned we are a family of four and with such familial arrangement dilemmas abound. Right off the bat I knew one thing: that we would need 2 days to visit the Alhambra. So without thinking twice I bought two sets of tickets. If you are in the same demographic group as us and if you have the extra day, just do it. I would have regretted immensely if we had bought tickets for just one visit. The Alhambra is a surreal place and it just can't be rushed. If you are single, sure, one visit is enough. But parents know exactly what I am saying - very young children get tired, hungry, and cranky as anyone, the difference is that they haven't been molded by societal reins yet and tend to demonstrate their displeasure by way of wailing, loudly. So know the limits of your child. I knew that ours would last about 4 hours before meltdown. Also remember that southern Spain can be terribly hot during and around Summer, so quite uncomfortable for babies . I was right on the mark and when the limit was reached we left the Alhambra right away, knowing that we would pick up where we left (mind you that we were staying in Frigiliana, that is exactly one hour drive to Granada). People say that you can't bring food. It's true that the rules say no food, but a lot of people had their own food and the staff were OK with it. Once you enter the complex there are only vending machines with sodas and very unappetizing white bread sandwiches. Just bring food. Another dilemma was how to transport the children within the Alhambra. The three year old walks everywhere and she managed most of it, even the bunch of stairs, but the infant had to be in a stroller or a carrier. We opted for a carrier. For most of the terrain of the Alhambra it's OK to use a stroller, but there are stairs, steps and strollers are not allowed in the palaces. You can check them in near the Nasir palace, but that would have been another step. So we carried the youngest in a carrier and it was fine. Backpacks need to be on the front but if your carrier is on the back then it is OK. I think either - stroller or carrier - is OK, it might be more a matter of preference, except from the alcazar towers at the very end of the Alhambra that can't simply be ascended with a stroller at all (that is where you have magnificent views of the city and the mountains). The Nasir palace is just stupendous - the minutia in the decoration is simply outerwordly. The nearby Charles V structure, in the other hand, has an interesting initial approach but it's miserably dull when compared to its neighbor. One regret was not obtaining an audio guide, but I am not sure if I would have paid attention to it. Before I forget, the giftshop at entrance is quite well supplied with Alhambra and Granada related stuff and worth a visit. And finally, driving in Granada may (or should I say ""will"") lead to traffic tickets - there are roads where you shouldn't drive, there are bus and cab lanes where you shouldn't be , all captured by cameras all over. If you are driving from somewhere else than Granada to visit Alhambra then it's ok because (at least with us) you hardly drive through the traffic-ticket-yielding-zones.",42,"Alhambra with children.

After reading numerous reviews, we took the precaution of pre-booking our tickets in advance and although we had a little difficulty locating the ticket office in Granada, it was a wise move. A taxi from the town centre cost 5 or 6 euros and is pretty essential as the roads leading up to the site are steep and not particularly pedestrian friendly. On top of that you will be doing quite a bit of walking at the site. We arrived earlier than our time slot to go into the palace, so took some time to view the stunning gardens and mountainside scenery. There are some really useful signposts dotted around telling you how long it would take to get to the palace so we were able to get to the entrance on the dot. As expected there are crowds but things are very well organised and we were only caught up in a couple of log jams. The palace is indeed beautiful and impressive and also surprisingly small so it didn't take a huge amount of time for us to get around. We then continued our tour of the Generalife gardens and palace (make sure you don't lose your tickets on the way as you will need to show them again). The architecture is typically lush with masses of ornate carvings and oblong pools but we have to confess that after seeing an overload of ordered and rigid symmetry, it was quite a relief to see the unordered chaos of the surrounding woodland, set out as nature intended! During our visit we would have liked to stop of in a cafe for refreshments, but we didn't see one. My husband spotted some food vending machines at the entrance of the toilets (!) but somehow we didn't find that very enticing. At the time of our visit the gift shop was shut, but this was probably just as well as we would have probably only spent a load of money on unnecessary junk. This was a great place to visit, and we are glad we did it. There was not quite as much magic as we expected but this is clearly a subjective thing.",48,"Another one ticked off......

There are some really useful signposts dotted around telling you how long it would take to get to the palace so we were able to get to the entrance on the dot. As expected there are crowds but things are very well organised and we were only caught up in a couple of log jams. The palace is indeed beautiful and impressive and also surprisingly small so it didn't take a huge amount of time for us to get around. We then continued our tour of the Generalife gardens and palace (make sure you don't lose your tickets on the way as you will need to show them again). The architecture is typically lush with masses of ornate carvings and oblong pools but we have to confess that after seeing an overload of ordered and rigid symmetry, it was quite a relief to see the unordered chaos of the surrounding woodland, set out as nature intended! During our visit we would have liked to stop of in a cafe for refreshments, but we didn't see one. My husband spotted some food vending machines at the entrance of the toilets (!) but somehow we didn't find that very enticing. At the time of our visit the gift shop was shut, but this was probably just as well as we would have probably only spent a load of money on unnecessary junk. This was a great place to visit, and we are glad we did it. There was not quite as much magic as we expected but this is clearly a subjective thing."

","1","2016-08-14","In The Alhambra of Granada you can see how different cultures have shaped the center and south of Spain in the past 1.000 years and how they overlap in a wonderful ensemble. The place is well preserved and still undergoing works of restoration and it will marvel you with its decoration and stories. Get your tickets in advance if you are visiting during summer and try to find a slot in the morning (9:00 - 10:00), as it will get really crowded at noon. Plus, there's a lot to visit, so you'll need about 2-3 hours in total. Then, there's the heat :) The gardens are not so impressive, but you'll love the palace. ",74,"Charming history lesson! .

I think you only need 3-4h there (unless you want to grab food etc). Note I booked the last tickets online for 7pm (to get into the Palace) however I met someone who waited in line in the morning and got an earlier visit. So if you miss out don't worry too much - will mean a 30 min wait to get a ticket but chances are you will be able to get in for the arvo session if you get your tickets in the morning!"

The tickets for the entire site are split into either morning or afternoon tickets. You will not be given any access until 2pm if you have booked an afternoon session to any of the ticketed areas. On top of this you need to book a time slot to see the Nasrid palaces.

It's worth booking though a group tour in order to ensure smooth entry and no waiting time.

Much of what remains has been restored in modern times, as the ravages of time (and war) have all taken their toll on the place, but there is still a significant amount remaining from the 14th century (and earlier), and much of the restoration has been done in a historically accurate and “enlightened” manner. We took a guided tour through it, which we would definitely recommend, as a good guide can provide an incredible amount of information not available to a uninformed tourist like us. It is definitely worth seeing."

There's a round amphitheater kind of, just next to the museum. Gives a very grand and archaic feeling. View of the town from the towers are really breathtaking. Generalife are the beautiful gardens and you can stroll around, sit and relax. Nice place for photographers. We took the 9am slot for the Nasrid palace and entered through the Nasrid gate directly, rather than the main entrance. This gives you ample time to enjoy the architecture of the main palace and also there is less crowd In the morning. Then we enjoyed the other palaces, generalife and exited through the main entrance. Reaching Alhambra is very easy. It's a 20 minutes steep uphill walk or you can take the C3 bus which runs every 8 minutes. You can take the bus to return also. If you return within one hour, there is no charge but you obviously will need more time than that to explore Alhambra. 3 hours is a comfortable estimate for the entire visit, including generalife. Best way is to book your tickets online since mostly tickets get sold out in advance. You can buy tickets on the spot but there's a long queue and you will have to wait for hours. Once you book online, you need to collect it from the Alhambra bookstore. Best way is to collect it from full service ATM of 'La Caixe'. More details will be provided while booking online.

Firstly, it is magnificent with so much history (Catherine or Aragon, Henry VIIIs first wife was brought up here) and really is a must see attraction. However our visit was spoilt. The tour is very hard for people who are less mobile and not suitable for people who have difficulty walking, like me. The guide rushed us around the gardens and the palace itself, it was March 2015. There were so many people it was hard to hear and keep up with him and we found with the uneven steps we were more concerned on losing our footing than looking at the beautiful gardens.

But the system for tickets is crazy and I have a huge handy hint. Although we'd heard you should book well in advance, by the time I got onto it there were no online tickets left. But, I figured you must be able to buy at the site and I was right. I was also told that you could buy at the tourist shop to save queuing. But when we went on the day to do so, we were told you could only buy at the site. When we arrived at the site, there was a long queue for tickets, and a shorter one for those who had already purchased. Both lines were moving at SNAIL'S pace for nearly an hour, and people were getting pretty testy. Finally I went and asked a man who had been roving up and down the lines chatting to people.

The site itself totally lives up to all the descriptions. It's magical. But the system for tickets is crazy and I have a huge handy hint. Although we'd heard you should book well in advance, by the time I got onto it there were no online tickets left. But, I figured you must be able to buy at the site and I was right. I was also told that you could buy at the tourist shop to save queuing. But when we went on the day to do so, we were told you could only buy at the site. When we arrived at the site, there was a long queue for tickets, and a shorter one for those who had already purchased. Both lines were moving at SNAIL'S pace for nearly an hour, and people were getting pretty testy. Finally I went and asked a man who had been roving up and down the lines chatting to people. He told me that you could go and purchase tickets with a credit card in another area and go straight in!

This majestic place cannot be described in words or pictures . One has to be there to experience the glory and beauty of this monument. Lucky for us , our hotel was right by the entrance of the monument. We had purchased our tickets online in advance from the official site. We were told to pick up tickets at the ticketing office anytime before Our entrance time was 2 pm on a Saturday . In order to avoid waiting in line to collect the tickets before our 2 pm entrance time , we walked up there around 9.30 am. To our surprise , there were multiple lines and the people who were watching the ones only spoke Spanish and gave us multiple information on how to get the tickets . Some said to bring our passports as well as the credit card. We left the line to go back to our hotel to grab our documents and lined up again . We weren't the only ones . Many others had purchased the tickets simply to avoid lines and yet there was no lead guidance on what to do for people who did not speak Spanish. When we got to the front of the line, one of the officials told us that we should not be in this line and should go to another place to collect tickets . We left that line again and wandered off to an area where we saw a ticket collection machine . We put in the card and it gave us the tickets. By that time ,it was already 11.40 am. We thought that this was our tickets but another visitor told us no. He said that we had to brag these tickets to another office where the sign said "" information for group tours"". We went inside and luckily the lady spoke English , took our paper tickets and have us plastic cards as our new tickets . We got out of the complex at 12.42 pm,ate lunch and came back to get inside around 1.45 pm. Once we had the tickets , the line was not that long . We got inside the Alhambra gardens within 10-15 minutes.My suggestion would be to buy tickets in advance online and get the general tickets which include the main attraction , the palacio nazarid or Nasrid palaces as well as Alcazaba and Generalife Gardens. Avoid getting these tickets on site as they have limited no of people to give there and you donor want to get there only to be told that there are no tickets . Prior to buying tickets in advance ( usually a few weeks esp around oral season ),read about the types of tickets and times on the official website as well other websites fir travel information like trip advisor , Rick Steves Europe travel etc. Note that you can only enter the sites within the deaf atee time. Once you arrive in Granada , get your tickets either the day before ( if your tour starts in am the next day)or the morning of ( if your tour starts in the afternoon).

Some said to bring our passports as well as the credit card. We left the line to go back to our hotel to grab our documents and lined up again . We weren't the only ones . Many others had purchased the tickets simply to avoid lines and yet there was no lead guidance on what to do for people who did not speak Spanish. When we got to the front of the line, one of the officials told us that we should not be in this line and should go to another place to collect tickets . We left that line again and wandered off to an area where we saw a ticket collection machine . We put in the card and it gave us the tickets. By that time ,it was already 11.40 am. We thought that this was our tickets but another visitor told us no. He said that we had to brag these tickets to another office where the sign said "" information for group tours"". We went inside and luckily the lady spoke English , took our paper tickets and have us plastic cards as our new tickets . We got out of the complex at 12.42 pm,ate lunch and came back to get inside around 1.45 pm. Once we had the tickets , the line was not that long . We got inside the Alhambra gardens within 10-15 minutes.My suggestion would be to buy tickets in advance online and get the general tickets which include the main attraction , the palacio nazarid or Nasrid palaces as well as Alcazaba and Generalife Gardens. Avoid getting these tickets on site as they have limited no of people to give there and you donor want to get there only to be told that there are no tickets . Prior to buying tickets in advance ( usually a few weeks esp around oral season ),read about the types of tickets and times on the official website as well other websites fir travel information like trip advisor , Rick Steves Europe travel etc. Note that you can only enter the sites within the deaf atee time. Once you arrive in Granada , get your tickets either the day before ( if your tour starts in am the next day)or the morning of ( if your tour starts in the afternoon). Go to the information office to the left of the gift shop and to your far right as you face the ticketing office . There will be a lot of walking so give your self one half day for the visit"

We were not given a map with our audio equipment so we had to read signs to figure out where we were most of the time.For the price you charge we did not feel we got good value for our money.All in all a very disappointing experience.M.

Also get there for the start of your session as the visit takes a good few hours. The majority of the fort is able to be visited on the general ticket which is the one we had. Make sure you climb all the towers (not too bad even for someone with a fear of heights) as the views over Granada and the Sierra Nevada are stunning. Make sure you visit the Carlos V palace as it contains a surprise. The walk up from the city is steep but not too long and is worth doing as you get to see all the fountains and statues on the way up. Make sure you follow the signs to the main entrance to pick up your tickets and don't follow the temptation to go through any open gates before that as otherwise you'll have to retrace your steps.

Unfortunately the slots go quickly and if you are just touring you often do not have a concrete date to book.The good news is that they keep back 30% of their tickets for sale on the day. The bad news is the ticket office opens at 8 am and most hotel receptions will advise you turn up to queue by at least 7 am to have a chance of getting a ticket. Hence every one turns up early and you arrive with a queue of over a 100 in front of you by 7 am.We arrived in the afternoon so went for a walk up the hill to scout it out. It turns out that there are two ticket offices, one for cash purchases with 5 or so desks and one automatic one for card purchases with 4 machines or so. Talking to one of the attendants they said that there are separate queues for each office in the morning and that (usually) the automatic office has a much smaller queue. You can't get concessions there though such as AOP or disabled discounts, you need the cash desks for that.We turned up at 6:45 am to see a queue of over a 100 people by the cash office so joined it. Then my wife went to see how big the automatic office queue was. The answer was 5 so we quickly swapped. Even though my wife shouted this across the queue to get me to leave it no one seemed to follow us. Strangely the queue remained small until about 7:30 am when others started to come along and ask others what the queue was. At 8:00 am the doors were opened, we were at a machine within 2 minutes and walked out with tickets 2 minutes later.The cash desk queue had not gone down much by then and the display board over the entrance that shows how many tickets were left was rapidly decreasing. We calculated that they would run out in about half an hour and that our original place in that queue would most likely have failed us (each person can book up to 10 tickets!)

The whole place seems to be based on the water supply so there are lots of fountains and water features including the 'water steps', which adds to the beauty of many of the photographs. The Nasrid palace is the area that you purchase the timed ticket for. This controls the number of people in there at any one time making it easier to appreciate the intricate interiors.General advice if planning a visit. 1. Probably too hot in the main summer months, September / October are good times2. Get tickets well in advance, saves a lot of queuing.3. To make the most of visit, go with a guide or get an audio guide4. Take some snacks / drinks and allow at least 3 hours."

However, the organisation of visitors is a bit chaotic as is the case in more than one attraction in Spain! So, top tips... If you want to be sure of a ticket to get in, pre-book with Ticketmaster, Spain. If at all possible book for the morning session 8.30am as in summer months it is cooler. If you manage to book the 8.30am slot you need to get there about 8.00am. By that time there will already be at least two queues forming, one for tourists who are still hoping to buy on the day, if there is any availability and another we were not clear about but seemed to be people who were carrying print offs of pre-booked tickets. We were directed by a security guard who was only really concerned with crowd control to the second queue as we told him we had pre-booked, however, I left my husband in that queue as I saw a guy wearing a t shirt with a big information sign on and enquired of him where or what we should be doing. So glad I did as he directed me to some ticket machines that were (curiously, not obvious or close to the ticket office) where we could obtain our tickets as long as we had the original credit card with which we had booked. There was no queue and the process was easy. However, by this stage time had ticked on and when I looked at our tickets our time slot to enter the Nasrid Palaces (furthest from entrance and most spectacular part of the Alhambra) was indeed 8.30am! It was by now close to 9.00am so we had to sprint down to the Nasrid Palaces. Fortunately we stopped to purchase an Audioguide in front of the Palaces entrance and the Spanish lady did us the best favour ever as being totally English my husband would have stood at the back of the very long queue already formed in front of the barrier ( of people with 9.00am slots) and we would have missed our slot by the time we had reached the front, but taking the lady's advice we went straight to the front of the queue and showed our ticket and the guide waved us through with seconds to spare ( they are very strict with the time slots because of the volume of visitors, we experienced this at the Mosque/Cathedral at Córdoba too, so be aware!). So, the moral of the tale... Be organised and leave enough time, other than that....have your camera battery fully charged as you will just want to keep snapping jaw dropping architecture at every turn. Move round the Alhambra areas (Palacio de Carlos, Alcazaber and Gardens of Generalife, all included in the price of your ticket) and see it all as your ticket will be scanned and will eventually expire as the afternoon visitors start entering the site. To finish, even if you are not staying in the Parador at the Alhambra you can go in and sit in the garden and have lunch, or 'just' a very good coffee which comes with a fig on a stick coated with the most delicious dark chocolate!

By that time there will already be at least two queues forming, one for tourists who are still hoping to buy on the day, if there is any availability and another we were not clear about but seemed to be people who were carrying print offs of pre-booked tickets. We were directed by a security guard who was only really concerned with crowd control to the second queue as we told him we had pre-booked, however, I left my husband in that queue as I saw a guy wearing a t shirt with a big information sign on and enquired of him where or what we should be doing. So glad I did as he directed me to some ticket machines that were (curiously, not obvious or close to the ticket office) where we could obtain our tickets as long as we had the original credit card with which we had booked. There was no queue and the process was easy. However, by this stage time had ticked on and when I looked at our tickets our time slot to enter the Nasrid Palaces (furthest from entrance and most spectacular part of the Alhambra) was indeed 8.30am! It was by now close to 9.00am so we had to sprint down to the Nasrid Palaces. Fortunately we stopped to purchase an Audioguide in front of the Palaces entrance and the Spanish lady did us the best favour ever as being totally English my husband would have stood at the back of the very long queue already formed in front of the barrier ( of people with 9.00am slots) and we would have missed our slot by the time we had reached the front, but taking the lady's advice we went straight to the front of the queue and showed our ticket and the guide waved us through with seconds to spare ( they are very strict with the time slots because of the volume of visitors, we experienced this at the Mosque/Cathedral at Córdoba too, so be aware!). So, the moral of the tale... Be organised and leave enough time, other than that....have your camera battery fully charged as you will just want to keep snapping jaw dropping architecture at every turn. Move round the Alhambra areas (Palacio de Carlos, Alcazaber and Gardens of Generalife, all included in the price of your ticket) and see it all as your ticket will be scanned and will eventually expire as the afternoon visitors start entering the site. To finish, even if you are not staying in the Parador at the Alhambra you can go in and sit in the garden and have lunch, or 'just' a very good coffee which comes with a fig on a stick coated with the most delicious dark chocolate! Enjoy!"

Didn't know it until the day that we were driving to Granada when I was reading about Alhambra from Steve Rick's guide book. Take Steve's advice seriously, if you don't have advance ticket and need to buy it the same day, you have to arrive the site no later than 7:30am to wait for the ticket counter to be opened at 8am. We arrived about 7:35am and there were at least 80 people in front of us. Good thing is when I checked with the hotel staff for her advice, she mentioned that is a separate line for credit card purchase machine which is usually shorter. Glad we found that line and only 20 people were waiting and we were lucky to get 6 tickets for the morning entry. If we waited on the long cash line, we probably would not be getting the morning entry ticket but need to take the afternoon ticket and come back at 2pm. Or worse, no ticket available at all. Another advice is there is a time stamp for the palace visit. There is a small summer palace at the end of the other side of garden which only allow visit within 3 hours of the time stamp. We didn't know that but see a family got turned away from entering because they just missed their window by 15 mins. My opinion is that it is not a must for the summer palace but if you want to see everything in you admission, bear in mind that there is a time window seeing that.",332,"Get ticket in advance or start very early in the morning.

"rn304873656","LILLY-TOUR","London, United Kingdom","23 reviews","Wonderful","1","2015-08-30","This is a wonderful place to visit and I am going to give just advice regarding the visit. TIMING: I would recommend to allow up to 3 hours 1/2 to visit all the beautiful Alhambra.Generalize: approx 1 hourAlcazaba: 1/2 hour. No trees or shadows except at the end when you walk through a small garden. Avoid to visit at hot hours. Nasrid Palaces: 45mn. Wonderful! Partal palace and gardens: 45mn. Must do; it is charmingCharles V palace: 10mn + potentially museum but we didn't do it so not sure about the timing.BOOKING: We booked our tickets one month earlier but I would recommend even earlier. We booked via Ticketmaster which was easy. When you arrive in Granada, just go to the main entrance (whenever is your ticket) and collect your paid tickets at automated machines that are located behind the store (each machine is for a specific ticket type; one for day tickets, one for night tickets) so we avoided the long queue for people without tickets. However, be careful that if you have bought discounted tickets (for children or elderly) you will have to exchange these discounted tickets received at the automated machine (these tickets are without barcodes) to a front desk (dedicated to this) with proof of age (ID). We didn't know that so when we entered from another entrance (Gate of Justice) we were not allowed to get in and had to go back to main entrance to do it (we lost 1/2 hour!).TICKETS: we would recommend to buy the ticket for the full visit, all the more that the price is a good value (approx 15€ for all Alhambra). If it is in Summer, a night visit is also a must to enjoy night lights and fresher wheather! We did both; Nasrid palace at night and the following morning the full visit with Nasrid Palace day visit as well. WHEN: in Summer I would recommend night visit as well as morning visit as the weather is so much cooler and bearable up to 11:00am. Start at 8:30am when gates open as there are less people and it is the best temperature and lights for pictures. Start with Generalife gardens, then at 9:30-10:00am visit Alcazaba when it is not too hot (I did at 1pm and I was boiling!) then Nasrid Palace or Partal palace&amp;gardens. Not much to see at Palace Charles V but there are also the museums that we didn't visit. ENTRANCES: there is the main entrance where you can get your tickets and the audio guide (recommended as there are very few information onsite otherwise). Then there are other entrances where they check your tickets (photo of the map with red circle for each entrance):One for the GeneralifeOne close to the ParadorOne for AlcazabaOne for Partal (you can get in via the walk between Charles V Palace and church of Santa Maria)One for Nasrid Palaces: ticket with specific allocated time (long queue to get in!)You can get in and out with your ticket as long as you stay in your allocated time (for example morning tickets are for entrance between 8:30am to 2pm) OTHER: unfortunately there are no coffee/bar where you could stop and enjoy refreshment while seated but there is a little kiosk where you can get drinks (no seats) close to Alcazaba. If you can afford and have the chance to get a room, staying at Parador hotel is a must! This is a old Nasrid palace converted into a Franciscan convent and recently in a hotel who is so convenient as located within the Alhambra. You can visit the Alhambra from there without going back to the main entrance. You can also enjoy this hotel for lunch or dinner and enjoy the beautiful view on the Generalife. If your budget doesn't allow it, there is also the America hotel that is located very close to the Parador (we just pass through so not sure what it worth it). Hope all these tips will help you.

We booked a guided tour and it lasted about 3 hours. Our guide was informative and I think it is worth booking rather than just buying a ticket and doing it by yourself. You should book the tickets online otherwise you risk disappointment. Only a certain amount are issued on a daily basis and you have to queue at the ticket office from 7 in the morning.

We went for the general visit for 15€ per person. Then when in Malaga we bought our ALSA bus tickets a day before the visit. I recommend you to do that because often the automatic machines at the bus station don't work and the queues are long at the ticket counters. We opted for the expensive supra tickets because they offered a few amenities (basically more space and wifi) alas they do't run frequently so if you want a return trip on the same day with supra buses you might have to be careful with the time of departure from Granada in order not to be too tight while in Alhambra. Anyway arriving in Granada with the supra buses of Alsa took 1 hour and 40 minutes. We arrived at the Granada main bus station but from there, there was no direct connection to Alhambra by bus. So what one must do in order not to take a taxi is to take a local bus to the area of the cathedral and from there to change to the small bus that drive straight to Alhambra in 15 minutes. The ticket is the same for all the buses and is valid for 1+ hour and costs 1,30€. So not bad. Arriving in Alhambra is a bit of a shock because there are hundreds of tourists forming at least two queues for different reasons and you must quickly ask and find out where you should wait not to waste your probably limited time. We first had to find the automatic machines to print our tickets. The fact that I had paid with my credit card and had the email receipt was not enough. Don't forget your credit card because without it you won't be able to print your tickets and enter Alhambra. The automatic machines are placed far at the back of the entrance complex so you will probably need to ask for directions. After printing your tickets you run to the queue for entering Alhambra complex. This in our case was not a queue really as much as just a crowd eager to finally enter the monument. We entered relatively quickly despite the congestion. Then we walked towards the Generalife gardens that were marvelous and took us 30minutes with a restroom visit included. Our entry time for the palace was at 15:00. We arrived at 14:30 only to find a very long queue of people who were also supposed to enter at 15:00. We waited under the boiling sun for 35 minutes until the guard started letting us pass at 15:05. Then there was the next queue where another guard was checking our tickets at the actual entrance of the palace. Then the palace! It was beautiful, bare, and crowded with visitors. Some halls had magnificent floors and ceilings and breathtaking views of Malaga, but still there were tens of people everywhere we went. The palace is not very big so in 30-40 minutes you may be done, in which case you either had enough and want to escape Alhambra or continue to see the newer Spanish palace and the archeological museum. We did the latter. The newer palace is interesting but most of it was inaccessible. The central circular courtyard is the biggest attraction, I think. The archeological museum is small and the curation is poor so you can walk through it in 10-15 minutes. The worst element of our visit to Alhambra was the extreme heat, the endless queues, and the long ordeal to get there. I don't recommend visiting Alhambra in late afternoon on a hot summer day. It is really a joy killer. We did enjoy discovering a bit of Granada while taking care not to miss our bus to Malaga. Granada seemed like a beautiful city much more picturesque than Malaga. I wouldn't mind visiting Granada again. If you want to have more time to walk around the centre of Granada you must arrange your visit so that you have plenty of time before or after your scheduled entry to Alhambra. We didn't have much time but still we managed to walk a bit and visit an old café. Closing this review I would like to say that the service design at Alhambra was poor. There were too many check points, too much waiting time, too little shade for visitors ... and too many of us visitors.

Depending on how deep you want to learn about this place you can easily spend from 2 to 5 hours. Lots to see. Purchasing tickets is a bit tricky. There are scheduled entrance times to the main section of the Alhambra. If you do not have pre-purchased tickets you can buy them there, but, they only have about 200 tickets to sell for each scheduled entrance. I strongly suggest you pre-purchase your tickets.

I saw the Challah in Rabat a few months ago and I liked it better. However, I actually fell in love with the Alhambra after I visited the Alcazar in Seville. The second is supposed to be way more opulent but I actually find the Alhambra much more authentic. Being located at the highest point of Granada overlooking the whole town... It is not that well maintained as the Alcazar and that was what made it more interesting to me. At the same time while walking through the halls of the palace and through the gardens it created this feeling of relaxation. A happy feeling.

I am a novice- but i was amazed at just the Nazaries Palace. What impresses me (an Indian) is how well it is preserved- for perspective this is from 11-12th century- so is Angkor Vat (Cambodia) and say the Taj Mahal is 14-15th century and so on. The colours have faded from many places (you can see restoration on) but the intricate designs are well restored. Make sure you book tickets for the Nazaries palace! Its the centre piece. I cannot advise on others as i have not visited them. But even for this palace, about 2-3 hrs is easily required.

Alhambra is like an architectural maze which can mesmerize novices to art lovers alike. I am a novice- but i was amazed at just the Nazaries Palace. What impresses me (an Indian) is how well it is preserved- for perspective this is from 11-12th century- so is Angkor Vat (Cambodia) and say the Taj Mahal is 14-15th century and so on. The colours have faded from many places (you can see restoration on) but the intricate designs are well restored. Make sure you book tickets for the Nazaries palace! Its the centre piece. I cannot advise on others as i have not visited them. But even for this palace, about 2-3 hrs is easily required. Plan other things accordingly.Wear comfortable shoes and if you have kids- put them in a stroller (if you have), it can be quite boring for them.

The bad: we missed some of the highlights because there wasn't room to fit our group into rooms that were too crowded; when the tour was over, our time in the Alhambra was over so there was no opportunity to revisit any parts we missed. Obviously, the best thing to do is buy tickets online in a timely manner so you can tour at your pace. You can also get an audio tour with your ticket.

The overall design is beautiful, the tile work, vaults and carvings inside are magnificent, and the gardens blend beautifully with the Moorish architecture. We were very happy with the way we planned our visit. We first visited the Nasrid Palace at night. Although you miss a lot of detail because of the low lighting, we certainly got a feel for the place. There was no mistaking the beauty and it was amazing to be in some of the rooms with no one else there. We also enjoyed the quiet! We returned the following day for the full visit including the Nasrid Palace and the Generalife gardens. You can also enjoy the views of the city and countryside at both times, though of course you can see more during the day. I strongly recommend this approach. For much of the year, it is imperative to get your tickets ahead of time and I recommend that you do so if at all possible. It was quite easy to buy tickets on line through Ticketmaster via the official Alhambra web site. Before you go to the Alhambra, you can save time by going to any LaCaixa Bank ATM. You have to search a bit on the screen but you will find a button to click to get Alhambra tickets. With those, you do not have to wait in line at the Alhambra gate, other than waiting for your time to enter. We went to the ATM on Calle Gran Via de Colon. Unfortunately a group of panhandlers camps out there, at least they were there each time we passed. They did not cause us any problem but if that will make you uncomfortable, you might want to look for another ATM.",430,"Deserves its fame and its spot as the most visited attraction in Spain.

It is quite important to book the tickets in advance because they can be hard to get otherwise. 1/3 of the tickets are released well in advance, 1/3 a few days before and the rest is basically for the same day so the ticket system is a bit difficult. There are also different types of tickets, but we chose the one which included everything which was about 16 euros if I remember correctly. Only a limited amount of people can be at there at the same time so you actually get an hour for when you can visit the Alhambra. We for example were allowed to enter from 14 until 20. The area is quite big so you should plan a bit how to visit it. If you have the tickets for the Palacio Nazaries, you actually have to be there at a certain hour and if you miss your slot, you can’t enter, so you should plan your visit according to that.We started by visiting the Generalife, which was the summer house of the residents of the Alcazaba. It is a really pretty palace with amazing views over Sacromonte and Albayzín. After that we went to the Alcazaba which is the fort of Alhambra. The view up there were even more amazing and you could see the whole of Granada. Last we visited the Palacio Nazaries which was the usual residence of the Alcazaba. There you can find the famous lion fountain.

Its pretty easy to get to and I have explained that first in the review. (excuse the long review but it may have useful tips)Firstly the tickets. Tickets are available online via Ticketmaster Spain (paid Euros 15/person) and I had booked nearly 2 months in advance (though I think there are enough tickets available at site from the queue I saw). You can choose the time of the day you want to visit from the time slots given online (more on the timing later). You will pay by credit card and you can use the same card on a machine at the venue to swipe and collect your tickets (you can carry a printout of your receipt as well, just in case)Getting there: We were to go from Malaga and our original plan was to drive. However we were recommended the bus to Granada and that turned out to be very efficient. We took the bus tickets from the bus station (@11 Euro per person one way). Its the ALSA bus service. Extremely smooth, great buses with FREE WIFI. It reached in an hour and 45 mts at the Granada Bus Station. Its better to plan to reach Granada Bus Station at least 2 hours before your Schedule Ticket Time Slot - you need about 45 minutes from the Bus Station to Alhambra and advisable to reach ""one hour earlier"" than your time slot (why - see below). From the Bus Station to Alhambra may seem a tedious journey (if not taking a taxi) as you need to take 3 buses but its pretty efficient as all buses ply at great frequency. Here is the Bus Station to Alhambra route:1. Take Bus ""N4"" from the Bus Station to Caleta (next bus from same stop)2. Take the Bus ""LAC"" from Calmat to the Cathedral. It will stop 100 mts short of Cathedral. Just walk right ahead (you will see the small red buses from a distance)3. Finally, take the small red bus ""C3"" to Alhambra. 4. NOTE - the SAME bus ticket bought in the first bus will be used ""throughout"" to Alhambra- its costs Euro 1.2 per person one way, please retain it till you reach Alhambra.5. Follow same order back from Alhambra with a fresh ticket on the C3.(the above will be very useful if you don't speak Spanish !!)Reaching Early: We had chosen 11:30 AM as we wanted enough travel time from Malaga and of course, the great morning light for Photography. Do note that 11:30 in this case is the time to enter the Nasrid Palace and you can get into Alhambra even earlier with that ticket (you will need 35-45 minutes of leisurely walk to reach the palace entrance anyway). So my suggestion would be to reach an hour earlier and explore around. Hence the earlier suggestion of planning to reach the Bus Station about 90 mts or couple of hours before your slot. For our 11:30 Slot, we took the 8 AM bus from Malaga, reached Granada Bus Station around 9:45-9:50. Post inquiries, boarded our first bus around 10, reached Alhambra at 10:45 and entered straight away. Worked out well.Now about the Alhambra: A Fascinating walk in the gardens followed by a visit to the beautiful Nasrid Palace. Enjoy at your own pace - at comfortable pace, clicking pictures along the way, no rest stops or cafe breaks, we did it in 2 hours. You can plan accordingly. We did not take the Audio guides so cannot comment on that. The weather was fine (Mid March, went upto 22 Degrees around noon) so one need not be fully covered.We took the 3 PM bus back to Malaga (and got at least an hour for lunch!!) and I strongly recommend the bus route for its comfort.

Worked out well.Now about the Alhambra: A Fascinating walk in the gardens followed by a visit to the beautiful Nasrid Palace. Enjoy at your own pace - at comfortable pace, clicking pictures along the way, no rest stops or cafe breaks, we did it in 2 hours. You can plan accordingly. We did not take the Audio guides so cannot comment on that. The weather was fine (Mid March, went upto 22 Degrees around noon) so one need not be fully covered.We took the 3 PM bus back to Malaga (and got at least an hour for lunch!!) and I strongly recommend the bus route for its comfort. Overall an enjoyable day-trip, reasonably priced (Bus tickets from Malaga per person is about 22 Euros Return fare plus 15 Euros Alhambra entrance fee) and we were back in Malaga for more site seeing by 5 PM !!Enjoy the trip !!"

I would not recommend this attraction to anyone who has problems with steps or walking long distancees.

However, the grounds are quite magnificent and the palaces exhibit the most amazing wall tiles and plasterwork. I would suggest 3-4 hours to visit all the different elements. The on site refreshment areas are just drink and snack machines. We went into the onsite hotel for coffee as we needed to warm up. The coffee was mediocre and the snacks were expensive but it was a comfortable place to sit. I think on reflection that a flask and sandwiches would have been a good idea!

You have a time slot for the Nazaries Palace , so do make sure arrive in time to go in there at the time it says , otherwise you could miss your slot &amp; it avoids disappointment ! I always said to my clients that it was impossible to describe the Alhambra you have to see it with your own eyes , to take in the unbelievable architecture , which is absolutely breathtaking , in places you can see the original colours ! ( To see how it would have looked the Palace of Aranjuez near Madrid , which is better in my estimation than the Royal Palace of Madrid , it has a room called the Smoking Room , which has the same Moorish architecture , with all the colours as they would have looked all those centuries ago , this Palace is well worth a visit too ) With its stalactite ceilings make dure you look up to these spectacular ceilings ! Most of the day excursions give you approximately a few hours there , if possible have a whole days visit , so you can take your time wandering round this beautiful haunting phenomenon ! &amp; we are so lucky that Washington Irvine stayed in the Palace &amp; actually helped to save it from it's ruinous state to eventually become a World Heritage site ! There is so much to see Carlos V Palace 16c he never sadly lived there , Patio de los Leones with it's spectacular columns &amp; fountain 11c , Patio de los Arrayanes with its myrtle perfume , Sala de la Barca , Salon de Empajadores it's remarkable dome represents the the seven heavens , Salon de los Abencerrajes where a massacre of a rival family took place when Boabdil ruled until it was reoccupied in 1492 by the Catholic Monarchs Isa Bella &amp; Ferdinand , Sala de los Reyes 14c the artist was a Christian working for the Sultan , Sala de Dos Hemanas , Sala de los Ajimeces &amp; the Maradona de Lindaraja both 16c , Jardines del Partal with its magnificent Atalayas towers , Torre de las Damas , the Nasrid Mosque &amp; it's Mihrab Torre , Cautiva &amp; Infantas Torres all 14c in the reign of Youssef the 1st , Museo de la Alhambra with its exhibits of Hispano- Moorish mastery of the artists &amp; craftsmen of the 10c to 14c , Museo de Bellas Artes paintings &amp; sculptures 15c - 20c , Alcazaba with its Torres Vela &amp; Bermejas red towers 8c &amp; 9c from the red clay , Puerto de Vino &amp; Puerto de la Justicia , The Generalife Gardens 14c predating the Alhambra absolutely beautiful with the calming sounds of water trickling ... look for the Cypress tree meeting place of two lovers , only the trunk remains rub it for luck ! When the Moors came to Spain in 711 they introduced to the Hispanic people , toothpaste , deoderant , perfume , rice , sugar from the sugar cane , cafe , coriander , basil , citrus fruits , vines ( they even made sherry &amp; could be beheaded if they got drunk , as it was against the Koran to drink ) , olive trees , mulberry bushes ( in some areas Narixa Nerja they produced silk for 6 centuries which they exported over the Far Eastern World ) , they had baths , steam rooms &amp; plunge pools ! A fantastic view of the Alhambra is to see it from the Mirador de San Nicolas with the back drop of the Sierra Nevada mountsins as its back drop &amp; st night it is floodlite &amp; giving you the vie of as it was lit by torchlight all those centuries ago ! There is so much to see in Granada , El Banuelo 11c the best preserved baths in the whole of Spain , the Cathedral 16c &amp; the Royal Chapel with the tombs of the Catholic Monarchs &amp; their daughter Joanna the Mad , opposite is the Madraza former university built by Yusuf 1 14c , a few steps &amp; you're in the Bib Rambla &amp; the tiny narrow streets of the Alcalceria ( old silk market ) now selling souvenirs ! La Cartuja the Cathedral Monastery 16c with its altar made of Lanjaron marble looking like cafe &amp; cream is well worth a visit too ,the Monasterio de San Jeronimo 15c &amp; just outside Granada you can visit the house of one of Spains famous poets Frederico Garcia Lorca &amp; his Balcony Window is still open ???

( To see how it would have looked the Palace of Aranjuez near Madrid , which is better in my estimation than the Royal Palace of Madrid , it has a room called the Smoking Room , which has the same Moorish architecture , with all the colours as they would have looked all those centuries ago , this Palace is well worth a visit too ) With its stalactite ceilings make dure you look up to these spectacular ceilings ! Most of the day excursions give you approximately a few hours there , if possible have a whole days visit , so you can take your time wandering round this beautiful haunting phenomenon ! &amp; we are so lucky that Washington Irvine stayed in the Palace &amp; actually helped to save it from it's ruinous state to eventually become a World Heritage site ! There is so much to see Carlos V Palace 16c he never sadly lived there , Patio de los Leones with it's spectacular columns &amp; fountain 11c , Patio de los Arrayanes with its myrtle perfume , Sala de la Barca , Salon de Empajadores it's remarkable dome represents the the seven heavens , Salon de los Abencerrajes where a massacre of a rival family took place when Boabdil ruled until it was reoccupied in 1492 by the Catholic Monarchs Isa Bella &amp; Ferdinand , Sala de los Reyes 14c the artist was a Christian working for the Sultan , Sala de Dos Hemanas , Sala de los Ajimeces &amp; the Maradona de Lindaraja both 16c , Jardines del Partal with its magnificent Atalayas towers , Torre de las Damas , the Nasrid Mosque &amp; it's Mihrab Torre , Cautiva &amp; Infantas Torres all 14c in the reign of Youssef the 1st , Museo de la Alhambra with its exhibits of Hispano- Moorish mastery of the artists &amp; craftsmen of the 10c to 14c , Museo de Bellas Artes paintings &amp; sculptures 15c - 20c , Alcazaba with its Torres Vela &amp; Bermejas red towers 8c &amp; 9c from the red clay , Puerto de Vino &amp; Puerto de la Justicia , The Generalife Gardens 14c predating the Alhambra absolutely beautiful with the calming sounds of water trickling ... look for the Cypress tree meeting place of two lovers , only the trunk remains rub it for luck ! When the Moors came to Spain in 711 they introduced to the Hispanic people , toothpaste , deoderant , perfume , rice , sugar from the sugar cane , cafe , coriander , basil , citrus fruits , vines ( they even made sherry &amp; could be beheaded if they got drunk , as it was against the Koran to drink ) , olive trees , mulberry bushes ( in some areas Narixa Nerja they produced silk for 6 centuries which they exported over the Far Eastern World ) , they had baths , steam rooms &amp; plunge pools ! A fantastic view of the Alhambra is to see it from the Mirador de San Nicolas with the back drop of the Sierra Nevada mountsins as its back drop &amp; st night it is floodlite &amp; giving you the vie of as it was lit by torchlight all those centuries ago ! There is so much to see in Granada , El Banuelo 11c the best preserved baths in the whole of Spain , the Cathedral 16c &amp; the Royal Chapel with the tombs of the Catholic Monarchs &amp; their daughter Joanna the Mad , opposite is the Madraza former university built by Yusuf 1 14c , a few steps &amp; you're in the Bib Rambla &amp; the tiny narrow streets of the Alcalceria ( old silk market ) now selling souvenirs ! La Cartuja the Cathedral Monastery 16c with its altar made of Lanjaron marble looking like cafe &amp; cream is well worth a visit too ,the Monasterio de San Jeronimo 15c &amp; just outside Granada you can visit the house of one of Spains famous poets Frederico Garcia Lorca &amp; his Balcony Window is still open ??? The above are some of my favourite places to see during your stay in my Beloved , Magical Granada !!! I hope you enjoy them too !!!"

Just seeing it from outside will do no justice to this magnificent place. A Unesco World Heritage site, Alhambra is a classic example of the extraordinary restoration works to bring history back to the current and future generation. We booked our tickets online for the afternoon session (2pm-6pm) but we only got there at 3pm as we got lost somewhere along the way. As a result, we only had 3 hours and it was quite tight to cover everything. You should allow at least 4 hours to see Alhambra at a leisurely pace. Generallife is near the main entrance and it takes about 15 minutes to walk to Nasrid and Alcazaba from the main entrance. The best way is to organise your visiting time to the Nasrid immediately before or after Alcazaba. Generalife should be visited first or last, not in between. Allow about an hour for each of them and a 20-30 minute walking plus rest time. Do note that there is a long queue for Nasrid even though you have an allocated visiting time.

It's a 'must see' attraction for anyone visiting southern Spain. I think that the gardens are as fabulous as the buildings. They are beautifully maintained with lovely planting, but also feature the most beautiful layout, patterned floors, etc.The buildings in the complex are stunning and the audio guide gives some context to it, but it is very sketchy. We sneaked a listen to a number of the guides that other people had hired privately. Clearly there was much variation in the quality of the guides, with some being amazing and others the very opposite. Do your research in advance and find out who people are recommending if you intend to hire a quality guide - well worth the investment and it will be something we do the next time we go.We went in October during half term. We arrived a little bit after 8am and there wasn't a queue!!! Hurrah! There were just 2 people in front of us. We didn't buy tickets in advance - we just bought them there once we'd arrived in the morning.Make sure to be in the queue to enter the palace at the time indicated on the ticket - which may be hours after you've entered the actual complex itself.You can easily spend the whole day here.At the end of the day you can either walk back down the hill to Granada (it's quite a long walk), get a minibus (public transport), or get the round the town tourist tour (but be careful as the last trip is quite early - they don't keep going into the late night - so don't fork out without finding out if you can make full use of the tour - which wasn't worth it at any time of day in my opinion!)If time is short, just go to visit the cathedral (which also closes quite early) - personally I liked it better than Seville Cathedral.So, back to the Alhambra - my advice... don't bother taking any photos. It's so crowded that you'll always have some damned stranger featuring in your photos. Enjoy the experience without the distraction of your camera, and buy one of the lovely books from the fabulous gift shop near the entrance which feature beautiful photography you can never compete with.We were staying near Malaga and drove there, so we parked in the car park next door - just up the hill (not cheap, but v convenient).

Inside the complex there's a Parador - extremely expensive - but if you're into expensive luxury then how lovely to stay the night there (or at least have lunch/dinner there). Otherwise the choice of food in the complex is not great and it would be worthwhile taking a packed lunch."

Booking tickets online, especially for the Nazrid Palace, was easy and from what others have said is better than buying tickets on the day.

Also, we collected the tickets on the day before from the Alhambra shop in the city centre (located between the Plaza Nueva and the Gran Via). That also proved very easy, by simply putting the credit card (used online) in a machine, with assistance if needed. However, because I had purchased a discount ticket (being over 65), we had to go to the main entrance of the Alhambra to provide evidence of age in order to get the discount. While it is possible to get a mini bus from Plaza Nueva to the main entrance, we followed advice to walk from the Campo del Principe - where an excellent tapas lunch set us up for the afternoon visit - from where a rather steep but attractive route leads to the Alhambra. Our experience was that four hours were not long enough to experience the whole of the Alhambra, especially as the Nazrid Palace is so very special. While the structure and layout of the Alhambra as a whole need to be seen, it is the Nazrid Palace that is quite stunning even after many centuries.

No hardship as the gardens / views are spectacular. There were lots of people visiting on the day we went but because of the size nothing was too packed although photo opportunities were tricky!

Yes ""The Alcazar"" in Seville is beautifully compact but can't be compared to the scale of The Alhambra.

You may not be one of them.Next buy your tickets in advance. Beware the official website says that you can pick up/print off your tickets from any branch of the bank “Caixa” in Spain. This in no longer true as you cannot.We had paid for our tickets and printed off our reservation number whilst still at home and knew that we had to use the same credit card in the ATM’s at the entrance to obtain our tickets. The ATM’s are hidden behind the souvenir shop and we could not find them but spotted a member of staff in a luminous yellow jacket with the symbol “I” on the jacket. This stands for information. He took us to the ATM’s and the bank card in the machine but still could not get the ATM to print off our tickets. He then took us to a long queue for the ticket office but as we had reserved/paid our tickets he took us to the front of the queue and immediately the ticket office printed out our ticket. This whole process took about 30 minutes so far!Our tickets had given us a timed entrance to the Nazrid Palace and you have to state your time when first purchasing the ticket at him. Pick a time of the day that will allow you to get from your hotel/hostal, queue for a ticket and queue for entry. This can take you as long as 2 hours from your hotel. You have been told this because if you miss your visit time for the Nazrid Palace then you will not be allowed into this part of the complex.By the way do not use the café/restaurant at the ticket office entrance as it is so busy you will wait a long time for service and they only serve via the waiters. However walk around to the other side of the ticket office near the souvenir shop and there is a little kiosks selling drinks snacks, sweets etcetera. Cheaper and no waiting here. Now you queue for your entry time to the whole complex be there at the gate 45+ minutes before. The staff will let you in minutes beforehand and this is just to enter the whole complex. It will take 15+ to reach the Nazrid Palace inside. You go past so small delightful hedges cut into shape but go straight to the Nazrid Palace as there will be another queue. It took us a further 30 minutes to queue for entry for the medieval Moorish Palace. This a a simple Palace and you can see much of it here on Trip Advisor. To be honest it was pleasant but we have been to the Moorish Palace in Seville which is equally good and the queues are usually less. Allow about an hour inside the Palace. Come out and go right and back along to the King Carlos Palace, the Christian one. This again you show your ticket but get straight in. Now it is much smaller in real life than it appears on the Trip Advisor photographs but nonetheless still beautiful. Remember to find the stone staircase inside and walk around the upper colonnade. Here you will be given free access to a small art museum of mostly painting. This palace you should allow 30 minutes. As you walk back outside the King Carlos Palace look for the giant bronze rings on the walls where horses were tied up and notice that underneath there was a ledge you could either sit upon or use to mount your horse. The Trip advisor photographs are few of this Palace and you will enjoy taking your own.You are now back near the entrance to The Alcazar, which means the military barracks presumably to guard the king. Once again photos are on Trip advisor. Again you will have to show your ticket to gain entry. Well photographed on Trip advisor but do not bother to take side paths but head for the entrance to the Tower at the far end. Inside it is not impossible to climb the busy staircase and it is not too high but very busy so take you time and try to stay on the outside of the spiral climb where there is a handrail. The views a the top are beautiful and calming. Up here you realise the decades of your life are passing by and yet God has let you remain upon this planet. You have views over the city so take your bearings and look for the Cathedral in the city centre and St Martins Church on another hill nearby. You will also be able to look back towards the Sierra Nevada and in the appropriate season there will be snow on the mountains. More importantly you realise by now hours have passed and you are tired so study the view of the Generalife (gardens) and decide whether you want to keep going to see them or not. When you come down the tower once outside but still inside the Barracks (Alcazar) look a a little arch up so some steps facing west which is where the Sun will be in the afternoon. Go out this gate if you are not going to see the gardens and walk through a narrow strip of garden which is a great place to get away from the crowds. There is limited seating here. By now from your original arrival time you have been probably 4 hours. Continue to the end of this strip garden and you will see on your right (West) a large arched roodway. Take this exit of you intend to walk down the hill back to the City centre. Now at the entrance I have just discussed there is a place for taxis to put down people presumably with handicaps but not much of the whole complex is not accessible to you if you are in a wheelchair. The King Carlos Palace and the Alcazar will be impossible to inspect if you have this disability. However you will be able to get to the grounds and they do have ramps. If you are walking impaired you will be able to do some of the complex but just take your time.There are toilets at focal points only and they are clean, modern and busy. The Spanish for toilets is “Aseos”. There was at least one decent sized kiosk selling snacks located between the Alcazar and King Carlos Palace. Note there is little seating inside the historic buildings but some in the common areas. If you are elderly do not rush but expect not to see everything. Now if you are taking the bus back to the City Centre or going to the formal gardens then follow the great mass of people back to the original entrance and follow the signs for the ‘Generalife”. Now if you going walk back to the City Centre it will take about 30 minutes and you keep going downhill. You did remember to get your bearings at the top of the tower in the Alcazar didn’t you? On the path downhill stay on the cobbled path and you will see a little gutter running with water each side of the path. You will pass a statue of Irving Washington. Think of his beautiful music and remember the USA exports arts as well as worldwidhe peacemakers. There are seats nearby. Evenutally you get down to the main road and turn left. Very soon you are back at the City Centre. If you get lost just say to a Spaniard “Donde Es Catadral”. Watch were they point with their arms. You will get back to the Cathedral.Now very few people want to climb up to the Alhambra complex and the way is to take the little red bus, cost 1.20 euro from the Plaza Nueava. You look it up on Trip advisor map. It is located at the Southern end of the Gran Via de Colon. If your hotel is central you can walk back from here afterwards. Now the map on Trip Advisor shows this as a roundabout but actually it is a TINY square or opening. The buses are start with the letter C and the Alhambra is we think number 1. So look at the illuminated sign on the front of the bus to know where it is going. Now the conductor will give you change but as the cost per head is 1.20 only give him a 5 euro note and nothing larger! Be ready. You can use coins with no problems. The buses depart about every 10 minutes and the journey takes about 10 minutes.We obtained a ticket price for Senior Citizens but remember to take you passport to prove age but this discount only applies to EU citizens. Study the street map here on Trip Advisor before you go. Mums and Dads. I did not see any buggies inside so check to see if you are allowed entrance.

It seemed out of the way, but we worked our itinerary to visit Granada as the last of our cities. I was really overwhelmed at the size and the beauty of The Alhambra. Fortunately we ordered out tickets in advance and arrived before 9:00am to begin our tour. We were scheduled to visit the Palacio Nazaries at noon and thought we had plenty of time to see everything else before. We decided to get the audio tour and I would definitely advise that. There is too much to learn and understand and this is a good way to accomplish that. The Alcazabar was quite enjoyable with gardens, old ruins, a magnificent bell tower and a chapel. We spent the morning walking through this area, then had lunch before our time for the Palacio Nazaries. Once inside there, we found the sights breathtaking.

When planning our trip to Spain, our son told us we had to see the Alhambra. It seemed out of the way, but we worked our itinerary to visit Granada as the last of our cities. I was really overwhelmed at the size and the beauty of The Alhambra. Fortunately we ordered out tickets in advance and arrived before 9:00am to begin our tour. We were scheduled to visit the Palacio Nazaries at noon and thought we had plenty of time to see everything else before. We decided to get the audio tour and I would definitely advise that. There is too much to learn and understand and this is a good way to accomplish that. The Alcazabar was quite enjoyable with gardens, old ruins, a magnificent bell tower and a chapel. We spent the morning walking through this area, then had lunch before our time for the Palacio Nazaries. Once inside there, we found the sights breathtaking.

If you are anywhere near Granada go to the Alhambra, do a really long day trip if you have to. Moorish palaces (Nasrid Palaces) are the highlight - with each room being more and more amazing. The walls, ceiling, tiles, everything about them is so detailed and beautiful, it's overwhelming. Be sure to book ahead so you can gain entry (although there are a number of more expensive ways if you need to). Save your energy for the Nasrid palaces as they are the highlights of the Alhambra, but there are also huge and beautiful gardens (The Generalife). The history is fascinating as well!

Come early or late in the year to avoid the heat, as there is much walking involved if you want to see all the palaces and garden areas. The average visit is said to last three hours, but we were there for six and did not hang about. Allow time for coffee at hotel America and maybe a lunch on the hotel parador terrace. The palace buildings are AMAZING, and the views from all parts are worth the admission charge alone.",546,"WOW!!.

Makes life a whole lot easier as there's only limited numbers available on the day. There's different types of tickets to buy, a ""general admission"" and a ""general admission with a palace visit at a designated time."" There's no sneaking in either. They'll ask to see your tickets at various parts of the place and once you've gone in, there's no going in again. If you're trying for tickets on the day, we got there at 7:30am and joined a very large queue for tickets only to have the last of the palace to tickets sell out right in front of us. But there's 3 time slots that include palace visits: morning, afternoon and evening, but limited spots. Still, even without the palace it's all very impressive and a good few hours walk. If you're without a guide, the audio guides require some sort of collateral to be left at the office which I haven't encountered before so you'll need something with your name on it. They're not bad. But no headphone jack if you like to do it that way. Really this place is THE thing to do in Granada so do your homework and have a good time.

Not to be missed....Plan: Book ahead! At least a month in advance is advisable, to get the times you require. The day we visited, they didn't have any tickets for those who had queued to buy them at the window. We took full price tickets for all, to avoid standing again in lines to validate discounted tickets. With our pre-booked tickets, we didn't have to stand in line and got a quick entry into the Alhambra. We had selected the afternoon slot. If you have the time, PLEASE select for the morning slot and enter at 8am. The heat during the afternoon slot in August is unbearable! For the Palace, we took the 4:30pm slot. Lines start at 4:00pm (not much of shade here) and they allow you inside at sharp 4:30pm. It takes about 3hrs average to see the palace, so time accordingly.How to go there: Take the C3 bus from the city center. (not plaza nueva. Routes have changed) Collecting tickets: Go to any Caixa ATM centers. Insert your card (same one which was used to book). It recognizes this and asks if you want to print the Alhambra tickets. YOU NEED CREDIT CARD PIN to continue. If you don't have the Credit card Pin, then go to the Alhambra gift shop in the city center. This shop has an ATM kind booth inside. Insert your credit card in there, follow directions and your tickets will be printed.Other Tips: Carry water bottles inside Alhambra. Take the audio guide from the main entrance. You will need to deposit your license/any ID while renting the audio guide. The Nasrid Palace has lots of shade inside, so no worries. The Alcazaba in the afternoon will roast and toast you:) You have beautiful views of Granada from the top there, so don't skip it. We followed the map and did Carlos first, then Alcazaba, the Palace and finally the Generalife. In this route, you won't be going back and forth and each exit will put you at the entry of the next. The Palace and Generalife gardens are very big. You will need major portions of your time to see these. You can spend your entire afternoon/morning duration OR at a minimum 4-5hrs. You will not find much seating inside to rest, so plan to be on your feet most of the time.

It takes about 3hrs average to see the palace, so time accordingly.How to go there: Take the C3 bus from the city center. (not plaza nueva. Routes have changed) Collecting tickets: Go to any Caixa ATM centers. Insert your card (same one which was used to book). It recognizes this and asks if you want to print the Alhambra tickets. YOU NEED CREDIT CARD PIN to continue. If you don't have the Credit card Pin, then go to the Alhambra gift shop in the city center. This shop has an ATM kind booth inside. Insert your credit card in there, follow directions and your tickets will be printed.Other Tips: Carry water bottles inside Alhambra. Take the audio guide from the main entrance. You will need to deposit your license/any ID while renting the audio guide. The Nasrid Palace has lots of shade inside, so no worries. The Alcazaba in the afternoon will roast and toast you:) You have beautiful views of Granada from the top there, so don't skip it. We followed the map and did Carlos first, then Alcazaba, the Palace and finally the Generalife. In this route, you won't be going back and forth and each exit will put you at the entry of the next. The Palace and Generalife gardens are very big. You will need major portions of your time to see these. You can spend your entire afternoon/morning duration OR at a minimum 4-5hrs. You will not find much seating inside to rest, so plan to be on your feet most of the time. Anywhere in the Andalusia area is unbearably hot post noon, mornings and evenings are cooler."

This time with my family including two teenage girls who were up for the excursion but not convinced. My wife took the trouble to book tickets in advance so as to get us in quickly.

There are staff on hand to assist you and although there is likely to be a queue it won't be as long as the one at the main entrance. If you take my advice and use the microbus turn left out of the shop and walk 100 metres or so until you reach a little square on your left and look for the C3 microbus stop. We were tolfdthe bus left from the cathedral - it doesn't although other microbuses to other destinations do. The fare is euros 1.20 per person. If you want to walk, turn right out of the shop and walk 100yards or so until you reach a C1 bus stop. Walk a few yards further and take the street on the right and start the climb to the entrance. With tickets you can enter anywhere. Without or if you are collecting tickets at the Alhambra you need to go to the main entrance. The walk is mostly traffic free and shady but if you have bad knees like my wife - take the bus.Once in the Alhambra I would suggest walking from the main entrance to the Nazaries palaces calling in at the Alcazaba and the Palace de Carlos V before visiting the main event. In other words stay the side of the street you worked up to get there in the first place. After the Nazaries the exit brings you out on the other side so walk through the gardens, back across the bridge and turn left to the stage area and enter the General Life gardens. All this can be done in 3 hours but a longer stay will be rewarded.Keep your tickets handy throughout the visit as it will seem that ever employee will need to see them! We found a Logis near the Justice gate and spent a quiet, cool hour having a beer and a snack in a shady courtyard.The actual Nazaries palaces are truly wonderful and my visit was a long standing ambition achieved. My preference is to wander and take in the whole. Follow the numbered signs for the audio guide if you want to ensure you don't miss anything as some of the route isn't too obvious. Numerous water fountains are placed strategically around the complex so it isn't absolutely necessary to carry water although we did. I would suggest two options for queuing for the Nazaries.

Take C3 bus from just round corner of alhambra information centre to get the gate of justice. It's worth going and the grounds and buildings are well respected and well looked after."

We spent a long time there from 2 until around 7 30 and it was very interesting and beautiful. It does involve quite a lot of walking but it's totally worth it!

The machine is a bit hidden behind the bookshop at the main office but it was so quick and we went straight in after that, skipping all the massive queue. Also recommend getting the audio tours as we didn't and there isn't a lot of information posted around the site that isn't to go with refurbishment. It's only at 10min walk from the cathedral and centro although a mini bus is available for those who don't want to walk up the hill. Generally an amazing visit and a must see!

The lines to buy tickets were rather short. We arrived around 1:30pm on a Monday in mid-June and got tickets for 5pm entry. We looked around the gift shop and got a preview of the palace art and then left the Alhambra and got lunch in the city of Grenada (at a cafe called El Botanico) and then headed back up to the palace. We returned around 4:40pm and walked through the main gate to the Generalife (gardens) for a quick bathroom stop then followed the route to the Nazari Palace. It's quite a walk so leave yourself enough time. You need to be at the entrance to the palace at your ticket time. We waited a few minutes then entered the palace and were enthralled, even our children were amazed. The Lion fountain was a big hit!

Our tips: The automatic kiosks to pick up tickets bought online are very badly signposted and we only spotted them after waiting 10 mins in the queue for the manned desks. They are behind the shop. The audioguide was excellent and really completed our visit, however the organisation at the site made it harder than it ought to have been to get hold of one. We were in the afternoon session and very few audioguides had been handed back to the main entrance so there was a huge queue of people wanting one but only a handful of them. The staff were extremely unhelpful and despite my attempts at Spanish, we were met with shrugs and apathy when we tried to ask for information as to if we could get one elsewhere. We needn't have worried, there is another site which hires them outside the Nasrid Palace/ Carlos V. Just a shame the staff couldn't have told us this. Make sure you have a driving licence or similar to leave as deposit. Overall, the Alhambra is stunning. Devote a day to it and take it all in at your own pace.

It’s a busy and very popular day trip so you must book early, especially if you want to get inside the 3 Nasrid palaces - which is a separate ticket. Only 100 visitors are permitted into the Nasrid Palace per day and you must specify am ( 8am - 2pm ) or pm 2pm - 8 pm or you can do a night tour. If you just want to visit the gardens and General Life during peak season July - August perhaps 2 weeks in advance but normally one week is enough. It was easy to reserve online or if you are already in Spain go to La Caixa Bank and buy tickets using their automated booking system - its inbuilt into the ATM withdrawal machines. We Self drove from Salobreñas on the South Coast and were delighted with how easy a drive it was. Alhambra has a massive ( paid ) car park. The gardens are fantastic - really well kept and cool. The palaces and monuments are very well preserved. The best preserved ancient monument I have seen. ALSO - good news is that you can visit Granada ver easily when you have finished at Alhambra. The ‘ petit Train’ stop number 1 starts at Alhambra and takes you all around Granada. There are about 12 bus stops and its hop on and hop off so you can visit several places and have dinner before returning to your car. The last tran departs at midnight - in true Spanish style - so there is no rush :) Granada has a myriad of tapas bars and restaurants to visit and they al look so quaint and inviting",603,"Alhambra and General Life experience - book at least 1 week in advance.

Ordering tickets online was a disaster. The site informed us that tickets could not be sent to Switzerland, and that we needed to collect them in Spain during our trip. So we selected to collect the tickets at a bank in Lorca, where we spent part of our vacation. The bank address given to us was incorrect, and when we found the correct address and presented our receipt on which it was clearly printed to collect tickets at this bank in Lorca, the response was shrugged shoulders and ""i don't know."" We called the number on the official website, and were given three options, none of which were given when we ordered tickets. One of the options was to collect the tickets from certain cash machines in Andalusia. Didn't work at all. We then were told to go to El Corte Ingles in Granada. No, they couldn't help us either. When we finally went to the tourist office, we were told we ordered the tickets so early (even though it is recommended to order as early as possible). A needlessly complicated, hopelessly confusing online ""service"".2. Bus ride to the palace complex. OK, we found the bus easily enough. Suggestion for the bus drivers: SMILE and GREET YOUR CUSTOMERS. I know it's probably a boring job, and all you see is tourists day after day, but hundreds of thousands of tourists dumps millions of euros into your city and region -- the least you could do is show a little welcoming nature.

The month of May isn't considered the peak months and the crowd was quite heavy therefore coming peak season between June to September will definitely be hectic. The Alhambra regulated the site by allowing each group to enter the garden at certain time and in between the tourists were tracked by the bar code in each station. There is another time restriction in entering the palace and same tracking as above. The system worked well considering the only time we experience over-crowding was in the initial garden stage.For my recommendation for visitors that want to appreciate the different parts of the Alhambra, it is best for you to move slowly through the first stage of the garden. Once the initial rush of the tourists passed, we are likely to have fewer people around. Hence the enjoyment of the surrounding can be done without interruption from over crowding.

Other than telling you that I truly loved Alhambra, which I did, I will focus on explaining the ticket purchasing system.When we decided to travel to Granada and go to Alhambra, all the tickets on the official website were sold out. That caused 2 of our friends to give up on the trip. So, there was just the two of us left and we decided to go and find a way to get in...If you know the time of travel in advance, you can get the tickets online (non refundable), but it can happen that they are sold out two or three months in advance. The official website allows you to purchase individual tickets up to 3 months in advance the most. Since the number of tickets sold online is limited, it can happen that you cannot get one when you decide to travel. But, don't worry!The sure way to get Alhambra tickets is to wake up early and be there around 06:00 am. You will be standing in line for 2 hours, until the ticket shop opens (08:00 am). The reason why you have to be there so early is because the number of tickets being sold at the physical ticket shop is also limited. They accept cash only. The ticket price if you buy at the ticket shop is 14 eur. The number of tickets one person can buy is limited to 10. So if you are travelling with more than 10 friends make sure to ask someone to go with you and stand in line together. There is another trick that you can use to speed up the process of ticket purchase - the ticket machines. Almost no one knows about them since they are hidden behind the souvenir shop, so the line in front of them is not too long. You still have to be there early since the place where the machines are is closed and it opens its doors at 08:05. There is a small surcharge if you use the machines, and that is 1.5 eur per ticket, so instead of paying 14 eur you will be paying 15.5 eur. That is not much since entering Alhambra is guaranteed this way. If you stand in line for cash payment and there are a lot of people in front of you who are buying 10 tickets each, it can happen that they run out of tickets...I am not sure how many tickets they sell per day, but I think the number is limited to 400, and you can see the displays showing how many tickets are left (which doesn't mean much if the people in front of you are buying more than 1 or 2 tickets each). There is no way to buy the ticket for tomorrow. If you use the ticket shop or machines you can only buy the tickets for that particular day. If you want to buy the tickets in advance you have to use Internet.Another thing you have to keep in mind is the time of Nasrid palace visit that is written on your ticket. That time of visit is fixed and allows you only a half hour gap. So if you get 11:00 am, you can enter Nasrid palace from 11:00 am to 11:30 am. Don't be late for you won't get in!

It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the entrance to the palaces from the main entrance to the Alhambra so take this into account when booking a time slot. There is a lot to see, I would suggest you allow at least 3 hours to see the palaces, Alcazar and gardens. You can walk up to the entrance to the Alhambra if you have the time and energy.

The palaces are unmissable, the most beautiful buildings I've ever seen. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the entrance to the palaces from the main entrance to the Alhambra so take this into account when booking a time slot. There is a lot to see, I would suggest you allow at least 3 hours to see the palaces, Alcazar and gardens. You can walk up to the entrance to the Alhambra if you have the time and energy. There are also frequent buses from Plaza de Isabel la Catolica for just over 1 euro each way.I would go as far as saying you shouldn't leave Spain without visiting the Alhambra."

I usually use a rollator to get around, but for this visit to the Alhambra we decide that it would be better to use a borrowed manual wheelchair, something we regularly do when visiting museums and other interesting sites. Although the Alhambra claims to be wheelchair accessible, we discovered that this was far from the truth. Our experience got off to a bad start from the beginning. As suggested by many other travellers, we bought our tickets on-line. we were then told that we had to go to a Caixa banking outlet to pick them up. So we drove to the nearest one, in Almuñecar, only to discover that they did not offer this service. We then had to drive to another outlet, in nearby La Herradura.The next day we drove to Granada and to Alhambra. Our tickets were for the afternoon, starting at 2 pm, with a visit to the Nasrid palace at 3 pm. We thought that we might be able to enter via the Puerta de la Justicia, as had been suggested by others, but could not drive there. We parked at the P1 (disabled) parking, driving around a barrier, since it was listed as being full. There were, however, several vacant handicapped spaces. There were no signs in the parking indicating how to get to the entrance without using stairs. Finally, we found a security person who showed us the way which involved going down a road which had a barrier across it. They could not, or would not, raise the barrier. Instead, two security personnel lifted me and my chair onto the sidewalk, drove me around the barrier, and then lifted me back down onto the roadway. We then proceeded toward the entrance and ticket booth. There, we had to get up onto the side walk, so my wife managed to help me onto the sidewalk from the road. We then had to get my discounted ticket validated. Fortunately I was in a wheelchair, otherwise I would have had to prove that I was more than 33% disabled to get the discount. With the tickets validated we were ready to enter. But first we needed to have lunch and use the bathroom. We had brought our lunch and so were saved form having to eat over-priced junk food.The accessible bathroom is near the entrance, but is kept under lock and key, so it is necessary to find a security guard who had to find the key to open it. It was roomy, clean, and well designed. It was now 2 pm, so we could enter the Alhambra.On the web site there is a map which has some indications of a wheelchair accessible route through various parts of the fortress. Unfortunately, in the fortress there are few such markers. Upon entry, it was not at all clear which direction we had to go to get to the palaces. We had been told that it was downhill from the entrance, when in fact it is uphill. Furthermore, it is uphill followed by a downhill slope over a pathway of paved round irregular bumpy stones!!! It was almost impossible for my wife to push me over this ""accessible"" path. It was only thanks to the assistance of a wonderfully muscular Swedish woman that we were able to get over that portion. From there, we managed to wheel over some relatively flat stones towards the palaces. We were now in the area where we would have been had we been able to enter by the Puerta de la Justicia. Once again we had to ask directions for the stair-free access to the Nasrid Palace. This involved another trek down a pebbled path, which we were able to do with some difficulty. Finally, we got to the entrance to the Palace, and had to wait until our 3 pm entry time. While waiting, my wife took a look at the route into the palace. There were stairs going into the palace, but they had sort of rounded off the steps so that theoretically it might be possible to roll down them to get to the palace. How we would be able to roll back up them remains a mystery.It remains a mystery because at this point we gave up. We were also getting anxious about how we would possibly be able to leave Alhambra. So finally, my wife found another security guard and explained our situation. They decided to allow her to drive the car (only because we were able to provide the plate number of our rental) to where we were, to be able to pick us up. She walked all the way back to the parking lot, then left the lot, having to pay for the parking even though we have a disabled parking sticker, and drove to where I was waiting.We realize now, that even had we been able to enter through the gate that we had wanted to, we would still have had to have the ticket validated at the other entrance, and we still would have not been able to enter the Nasrid Palace.

The signage for collecting tickets purchased in advance is non-existent, and the security guards are not helpful. They are also inadequately staffed. You practically have to damage the site in order for them to pay attention to you.The site organizers also need to do a better job of managing the hustlers who try to sell you rosemary sprigs, umbrellas and tissues while you're waiting in line or walking in from the parking lot. Some of their actions border on harassment, and are not acceptable.The lady working in the ticket collection area was very helpful and explained where to go and what to do. Fantastic. Started out by walking around the grounds waiting for our entry time to the Nasrid Palace. The Generalife is very pretty, but could be better maintained. I would also have liked to see explanatory boards or something in the free maps they provide to better explain the various areas of the site, their uses, and their historical value. I should be able to walk away feeling better informed and educated without having to book a tour or renting a headset.Signage around the site isn't bad, but needs to be expanded to include the linguistic needs of the visitors they get: I heard German, English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Mandarin, and Korean while I was there, yet signs are only in Spanish and occasionally in English. Considering the high cost of entry, they could do much better here.When it came time to line up for the Nasrid Palace, we were there at the time printed on our ticket, but had to wait... and wait... and wait.

I'd seen it the previous day in its glorious entirety, from 'across the way' at Mirador San Nicolas. I spent four hours there and came away wishing I had longer in Granada so I could go again. One visit isn't really enough to take it all in, without rushing somewhat. I couldn't have stayed longer as I was worn out! It's all spectacular but my favourites included the Mosque Baths and the many gardens, both in the Generalife and in the main area of the Alhambra. The Nasrid Palaces were breathtaking but it all felt a little rushed in the strictly observed half hour time-slot. My favourite place there was the Court of the Lions, and in the Generalife area I especially enjoyed the Court of the Water Channel. The Alcazaba was interesting and of course it's here, from the top of the Torre de la Vela (Watchtower), that you can enjoy the most commanding views of all. At every twist and turn on every path and stairway, it seems you catch your breath at yet another view - whether it's across the countryside or into the distant past in the form of a tower, a church, some foundations, a garden ... I was also pleased to see that there was decent coffee being sold, in real glasses/cups and at a fair price. The food prices looked reasonable too, though I didn't eat.When I return to Granada I would reserve tickets for two separate visits, spaced a few days apart and use each visit to focus on a pre-planned portion of the Alhambra; likewise for the Nasrid Palaces.

So when you visit Granada you must see this pearl of architecture from the time of the Moors.

The Telegraph wrote an article on 15 March 2012 about Granada and tickets to Al Hambra:“The town strictly limits the number of visitors to the Alhambra to 6,600 people each day, with just 300 every half-hour to the Nasrid palaces (Nazaries Palace).

This is a slightly nerve-racking experience as it's hard to estimate from the queue snaking around in front of you just how many places are left.

The Palacio Nazaries was my favorite. I can’t imagine how they made all of the Arabic carvings on the walls/ceilings. All of the work in the palace really makes you appreciate the craftsman who made it. It’s breathtaking. We visited on a Sunday morning. I would advise you to pick an early time in the morning to visit. This gives you ample time to visit before your period ends at 2pm (that’s when the afternoon session starts). It also gets very hot during the day. We printed our tickets at the Alhambra store in town, which made things a lot easier. Then we took the mini-bus to the Justice Gate and got dropped off there. If you don’t have printed tickets, you will need to go to the main entrance to get them first. Backpacks are allowed, but they make you wear them on the front. No tripods are allowed. Be ready to do some walking while on the grounds!The Reflecting Pool is truly a sight to behold, and you can get some amazing pictures of it. I loved the amazing ceilings throughout the palace. I loved all of the tiles and geometric patterns. The Sultan’s throne room is another amazing space, it’s just unbelievable. This entire place is a photographer’s dream. I’m huge on photos, so there was no shortage of picture taking for me. Room after room is amazing. Just thinking this place is 800+ years old and thousands of people lived on these grounds makes you think. There are so many great courtyards, fountains, and amazing views of the city down below. It is worth walking up to the top of the fort for the killer views of the city. The gardens are massive, so we only walked through part of them. They are truly gorgeous.

I'm really glad I went.Practicalities: book well in advance, especially if you want to go to the Nasrid Palaces. You'll have to choose a time to go in but if you leave it until the day of your visit, you're unlikely to get a ticket. What we did was to opt for the afternoon session and booked to go into the Palaces at 6pm. That gave us the afternoon to wander around the gardens which were stunning but didn't give us time to go to the Alcazaba. Obviously we could have visited those parts after the Palaces but by then we were too tired. The online booking is through Ticketmaster and you have to print out your ticket. You can do this at the main entrance or you can go to the Libreria de la Alhambra in the Calle Reyes Catolicos. (They'll tell you where to find it in the tourist information offices). If you have a concessionary rate, you'll get a ticket without a barcode meaning you have to take proof that you're entitled to the concessionary rate to the main entrance to get a proper ticket.You can walk up to the Alhambra from Granada and it's reckoned to take about 30 minutes but if you're softies like us, you can get a bus from the Calle Gran Via de Colon. Reading up about the Alhambra can be very confusing. Basically, when you go in, head off right for the gardens and some of the smaller (but impressive) buildings.

Having been to the Alcazar in Seville, I was less than enthusiastic about the Alhambra but it's one of those places that is supposed to be a 'must see'. I'm really glad I went.Practicalities: book well in advance, especially if you want to go to the Nasrid Palaces. You'll have to choose a time to go in but if you leave it until the day of your visit, you're unlikely to get a ticket. What we did was to opt for the afternoon session and booked to go into the Palaces at 6pm. That gave us the afternoon to wander around the gardens which were stunning but didn't give us time to go to the Alcazaba. Obviously we could have visited those parts after the Palaces but by then we were too tired. The online booking is through Ticketmaster and you have to print out your ticket. You can do this at the main entrance or you can go to the Libreria de la Alhambra in the Calle Reyes Catolicos. (They'll tell you where to find it in the tourist information offices). If you have a concessionary rate, you'll get a ticket without a barcode meaning you have to take proof that you're entitled to the concessionary rate to the main entrance to get a proper ticket.You can walk up to the Alhambra from Granada and it's reckoned to take about 30 minutes but if you're softies like us, you can get a bus from the Calle Gran Via de Colon.

I hadn't really appreciated before I went just how amazing the place is, but I do now. The site is extremely well looked after by the authorities and there was a refreshing absence of over-bearing Health &amp; Safety signage so beloved of British attractions and foisted upon us by our nanny state, and which can readily detract from the enjoyment of places.My husband and I walked round on our own and hired an audio phone which told us all we needed to know about what we were seeing - there are few information notices about the place and whilst we didn't want to slavishly listen to every word as it is easy to get 'information overload', we appreciated coming out of there knowing more about it than when we went it.There is a lot of walking involved, and the road up to the Alhambra entrance pavilion is steep, although lovely and shady. It is possible to take a taxi or bus up there. Be warned - walking down is even harder on the knees after trekking round the site! There are plenty of water fountains around and some exemplary WC facilities (i.e. lots of them, and clean). If you have mobility problems, the site could prove a bit difficult in parts. We saw quite a lot of people who were seriously under-prepared for the exertions involved in getting around and the fact that the paths in a lot of the very old parts are uneven and not paved.

The location is breathtaking with beautiful views at every turn. A steep climb from the old town of Granada takes you on a winding tree lined journey to the ticket office - but here the bureaucracy began. We collected our tickets a day early as we had booked on line. Ready to make the most of our 8.30 start and ensure we could see everything without rushing. So no queuing and straight in - except that our children's tickets needed to be validated. It said something to this effect on the ticket but we thought the staff scanning the tickets could do this. We were wrong, so we were rudely directed back to the queue for tickets and had to wait another 15 minutes for someone in the ticket office to look at our children (we weren't asked for proof of their age) so they could print out some more tickets for them that we could use. What a waste of time and no one mentioned this in any of the reviews or more importantly on the website where we booked the tickets. Never come across anything so daft or designed to confuse and annoy you before you even get into an attraction. We had booked a 9.30 ticket to access the Palacio Nazaries but again weren't sure whether this meant we could go in before 9.30 as the website says late comers not admitted. So we queued up again just after 9.00 only to be turned away and told to come back dead on 9.30. Which we did to then wait for another 15 minutes whilst all the tours were let in via a separate entrance. It would have been helpful to know that we had a half hour time slot to enter as whilst I pride myself on my good English queuing the Spanish don't understand queues and were jostling and pushing to get past. Once inside the space is intimate and beautiful. Particularly the harem with the beautiful marble lion fountain. Unfortunately this was spoilt for us as my husband moved to get a photo to where a group had just entered and was shouted at by an officious and pompous security guard. Apparently only groups were allowed that way! He was extremely rude and tried to square up to my husband who just asked where were we supposed to go (as it wasn't marked) and then called him 'macho'. My children were scared and embarrassed, and we felt his behaviour very aggressive for what is effectively a museum.

The Alhambra lives up to its reputation as a star attraction in Spain. The location is breathtaking with beautiful views at every turn. A steep climb from the old town of Granada takes you on a winding tree lined journey to the ticket office - but here the bureaucracy began. We collected our tickets a day early as we had booked on line. Ready to make the most of our 8.30 start and ensure we could see everything without rushing. So no queuing and straight in - except that our children's tickets needed to be validated. It said something to this effect on the ticket but we thought the staff scanning the tickets could do this. We were wrong, so we were rudely directed back to the queue for tickets and had to wait another 15 minutes for someone in the ticket office to look at our children (we weren't asked for proof of their age) so they could print out some more tickets for them that we could use. What a waste of time and no one mentioned this in any of the reviews or more importantly on the website where we booked the tickets. Never come across anything so daft or designed to confuse and annoy you before you even get into an attraction. We had booked a 9.30 ticket to access the Palacio Nazaries but again weren't sure whether this meant we could go in before 9.30 as the website says late comers not admitted. So we queued up again just after 9.00 only to be turned away and told to come back dead on 9.30. Which we did to then wait for another 15 minutes whilst all the tours were let in via a separate entrance. It would have been helpful to know that we had a half hour time slot to enter as whilst I pride myself on my good English queuing the Spanish don't understand queues and were jostling and pushing to get past. Once inside the space is intimate and beautiful. Particularly the harem with the beautiful marble lion fountain. Unfortunately this was spoilt for us as my husband moved to get a photo to where a group had just entered and was shouted at by an officious and pompous security guard. Apparently only groups were allowed that way! He was extremely rude and tried to square up to my husband who just asked where were we supposed to go (as it wasn't marked) and then called him 'macho'. My children were scared and embarrassed, and we felt his behaviour very aggressive for what is effectively a museum. This spoilt our visit and was doubly insulting when we could see the photo my husband was trying to take on all the postcards, but obviousl restricted only to tour guided groups and policed to this effect.

As stated in other reviews, pre-booking online is highly advised. We popped into the Alhambra shop in Granada the day before our visit and printed the tickets at their ServiCaixa ATM. The lady at the desk was very helpful and supplied with an Alhambra map as well. Having tickets enabled us to enter at the Justice Gate (not crowded) and go straight to our time allocated slot at the Nasrid Palaces. Purchased 2 audio guides (6 euros each) - ok for adults but not for children as commentary is somewhat 'poetic'. Queued for half an hour before entering the Palace complex. As there is a limit to entry numbers, the crowds were nowhere near as bad as I thought they would be. The Palaces are amazing to see - a photographers paradise. But put the camera down for a while and just take in the stunning architecture, study the intricate detail of the designs - it's truly inspiring. It takes at least an hour to see this area properly (we took over 90 mins) - kids will be bored by then! The Partal area is next (includes the gardens) and is a welcome change from the Palaces - not many people and a good place to chill, drink some water and enjoy the views. Walk up to the Generalife and wander through the lovely water gardens. There were less people here and it was much more relaxed. Use the tourist map provided to make sure you see all the best sights. The whole visit took us 6 hours (including lunch) but you could do it in 3 to 4 hours.

I must admit I was worried about the queues getting in etc. having read other reviews but experienced none of this. We had afternoon tickets but didn't arrive until 3.30pm. Parking was easy. Picking up the tickets from the Ticketmaster terminal also easy. A Spanish helper who spoke English assisted us and then gave us a site guide. Because I had a child ticket, we did have to go to reservations to have a bar code printed on it but again, this was very straightforward only having to wait a few mins. Parents - make sure you take your children's passports with you as I did, again based on reading other reviews regarding child tickets. I did notice people being turned away as all tickets were sold out so it really is a must to purchase beforehand especially during the Summer hols. I really enjoyed walking around The Alhambra, my only criticism of having to queue in the late afternoon heat for our timed entry @ 5pm to the Nasrid Palaces. Some sort of tenting or shade covering should have been provided and I could not have imagined queuing in the midday heat. We did see the Red Cross with someone inside the Palaces who obviously wasn't feeling well probably due to the heat. The Generalife Palace and Gardens was by far my favourite site to visit. The gardens are magnificent and the many fountains provided much needed relief to cool down even in the evening heat. We left the site around 7pm straight back onto the excellent motorway system to Mijas.

The first thing to do is to buy your entry ticket before hand, then you won't have to queue in the sun. Secondly beware of the audio tours you get offered from some of the tour companies, we had picked ours up the day before and when it didn't work at the palace we had nobody to sort it out for us.

"rn164524710","OTRA_13","Melbourne, Australia","30 reviews","An enormous place","0","2013-06-19","This place is interesting to see and has some very beautiful aspects to it; but we had been to the Alcazar in Seville a few days earlier and felt that the Alhambra was a repetition of this, just on a larger scale. To be honest, we enjoyed the Alcazar more. It has more variety in each of the rooms/areas, whilst the Alhambra appears to have the same (to the untrained eye) designs in each room. But, if you have not seen the Alcazar, then you are likely to be impressed. (Note: the gardens were nice, but I questioned whether this would be the case if the flowers were not in bloom).Our visit was on a Monday and we arrived at 8:30am. We had reserved tickets, but the line to purchase tickets at that time was very small - only a few people. Having said that, a lot of tickets are purchased in bulk ahead of time by tour group organisers, so even if there isn't a queue, that doesn't mean you will get tickets if you haven't reserved them ahead of time.If you are staying in Granada, then ask your hotel (prior to your arrival) if they can reserve tickets for you. Then you can print out the tickets at an office in Granada (or a ticket machine). This means you don't have to line up at all (very handy if your Alhambra visit is after 10am).When you reserve your ticket, you will need to choose a time to see the Palaces. Whatever that time is, you need to arrive an hour prior if you are picking up your tickets or at least half an hour prior if you already have your tickets. I chose 9:30 as our allocated Palace time; largely because I thought we would avoid the tour groups. This wasn't the case. At every turn there was a tour group, plus many school groups too. Needless to say, it was very crowded. Taking photos was difficult, as everyone wants to take the same photo from the same position. This meant a lot of waiting for your turn, and then you felt rushed to take the shot and move away. If you want to take photos without people in the photo, it is almost impossible. I found the crowds very frustrating and this really took away from the enjoyment of the visit.Whilst there are a lot of recommendations to visit tourist sites in the mornings to avoid the crowds, I have found that our afternoon visits to Spanish monuments were always less crowded (perhaps because people were trying to stay out of the heat).The Alhambra is the size of a small town and all of it is cobbled stoned, so you need comfortable, flat walking shoes. The cobble stones are also very well worn and this can make them slippery if the soles of your shoes do not have any grip (I found the cobble stones to be particularly slippery in the Arabic souvenir shop streets of Granada - avoid the centre cobblestones in those streets).Following the advice of other reviewers, we brought water and food with us to the Alhambra. This was unnecessary and in hindsight I would not have done so. Food and drinks can be bought from a restaurant and from food kiosks and vending machines. There are also many drinking fountains. The walk up to the Alhambra is 10 to 15 minutes (from the Plaza) and is uphill. You can also catch a taxi for 5 euro. If you are rushed for time, a taxi is ideal as they take you to the right entrance (depending on whether you are purchasing or picking up tickets or not).Lastly, avoid visiting on Sundays as entrance is free for locals and this makes it more crowded.",729,"An enormous place.

Having said that, a lot of tickets are purchased in bulk ahead of time by tour group organisers, so even if there isn't a queue, that doesn't mean you will get tickets if you haven't reserved them ahead of time.If you are staying in Granada, then ask your hotel (prior to your arrival) if they can reserve tickets for you. Then you can print out the tickets at an office in Granada (or a ticket machine). This means you don't have to line up at all (very handy if your Alhambra visit is after 10am).When you reserve your ticket, you will need to choose a time to see the Palaces. Whatever that time is, you need to arrive an hour prior if you are picking up your tickets or at least half an hour prior if you already have your tickets. I chose 9:30 as our allocated Palace time; largely because I thought we would avoid the tour groups. This wasn't the case. At every turn there was a tour group, plus many school groups too. Needless to say, it was very crowded. Taking photos was difficult, as everyone wants to take the same photo from the same position. This meant a lot of waiting for your turn, and then you felt rushed to take the shot and move away. If you want to take photos without people in the photo, it is almost impossible. I found the crowds very frustrating and this really took away from the enjoyment of the visit.Whilst there are a lot of recommendations to visit tourist sites in the mornings to avoid the crowds, I have found that our afternoon visits to Spanish monuments were always less crowded (perhaps because people were trying to stay out of the heat).The Alhambra is the size of a small town and all of it is cobbled stoned, so you need comfortable, flat walking shoes. The cobble stones are also very well worn and this can make them slippery if the soles of your shoes do not have any grip (I found the cobble stones to be particularly slippery in the Arabic souvenir shop streets of Granada - avoid the centre cobblestones in those streets).Following the advice of other reviewers, we brought water and food with us to the Alhambra. This was unnecessary and in hindsight I would not have done so. Food and drinks can be bought from a restaurant and from food kiosks and vending machines. There are also many drinking fountains. The walk up to the Alhambra is 10 to 15 minutes (from the Plaza) and is uphill. You can also catch a taxi for 5 euro. If you are rushed for time, a taxi is ideal as they take you to the right entrance (depending on whether you are purchasing or picking up tickets or not).Lastly, avoid visiting on Sundays as entrance is free for locals and this makes it more crowded."

The Alhambra sells out quick, so we made our reservation on-line using Ticketmaster months in advance. Once you get there, you can print your tickets ahead at the Ticket Master terminal located at the Alhambra's official book store in Granada's center (recommended) or at the Alhambra facility. Don't forget to bring the card you used for the reservation. You can take a bus, a taxi, or just walk to the Alhambra entrance from the center of Granada. Keep in mind the Alhambra is large with different ways to enter the four main attractions. The palaces draw the most visitors and visitation is organized by timed entry which you choose with the reservation. The lines to the palaces can be long so they recommended you arrive in advance of your slotted time. If you choose to ticket at the Alhambra, and you plan to visit the palaces first, leave lots of extra time. The palace entrance and the ticketing facility at the Alhambra are far apart. But, no mater how you organize your visit you will be captivated by the beauty, peace and extraordinary vistas the Alhambra offers. It's on the verge of being unbelievable except that it exists right in front of you. The human effort to build a monumental fortress and then overlay the artistry of Morrish architecture is stunning. In the palaces a meditative quality resonates even in the midst of exited visitors while the gardens provide tranquility and a cool refuge. The Alhambra offers a unique portal into the 14th century when carved stone and wood inlay were the expressions of inner life. If you're lucky you can spend all day, but four hours was all we could do until we moved on to an afternoon of tapas, shopping, and tea rooms.

The Generalife is simply beautiful, even in late october, there is still flowers. The Nazaries palace is an architectural jewel, the work those guys put in there is out of that world. I recommend it to anyone! Only problem is the information missing from room to room... I would have liked a audio guide but it wasn't offered to us, or simply a few panel of information about the rooms... It was sublime but read about it before you get in there, to appreciate it better. We had a ticket from 2pm to 6pm and we missed the museo de arte because it was closing at 2h30... that one u can do actually without the ticket for Alhambra.. it s in the middle of the place but u get to buy ticket for it in the building... the neoclassic one that seem a bit off.

So yes, you have to see it! Keep in mind that the Alhambra is a complex of sites-- the entry time on your ticket refers only to the Nasrid Palace, you can enter the gardens and the other attractions anytime you want, so come early! For seeing the Palace, you have a very specific window for entering and you cannot miss your time or you'll have to go get your tickets exchanged. Line up about a 1/2 hour before your time in the patio area near the Palace entry (which is about a 20 minute walk from the front gates). Here's a hint for getting your tickets-- you can purchase them in advance anywhere in Spain at a CAIXA bank ATM. Just put in your credit or debit card, and from the options at the top choose ""attractions"". Pick Alhambra and it will give you the choice of dates and times. Otherwise, you can purchase them on line, but you'll have to go to a Caixa ATM to print them out anyway. You'll have to pay the extra ticketmaster fees too.

The bus's end stop is Alhambra, very near the ticke booths. The driver will usually say it aloud ""Alhambra"", and most everyone will get off.3. Buy tickets online to avoid the ticket line, and be sure to bring with you the same card you used to buy it. You need the same card to retrieve the ticket (don't need passports, etc).4. as you're facing the ticket booth building, on your right, you'll see the Gift shop.

I waited in the preorder line for 15 minutes and the woman at the counter took a few minutes and then she figured out I had booked it for the day after the day I ordered the tickets in July. Clearly I was American and clearly I hadn't set up an elaborate ruse in order to visit the palace twice. I was clearly distressed and it wouldn't have hurt anyone for 2 more people to visit the palace. She put her hands up in the air like well, tough s**t and waved goodbye to me.So I stand in the buy tickets here line. I see that there are night tickets to visit the palace available, for 10 pm, it is now 5 pm. I ask the woman about night tickets, she doesn't speak English (I understand, I'm in Spain, I get it). She processes 2 tickets and I ask if they are night tickets using the Spanish wording on the monitor. She looks at me frustrated and instead of asking for help from someone she waves goodbye to me. I try to hand her a 100 euro note to pay for the tickets and she scoffs and throws it back at me. Then I produce a Visa card and she loves me.Okay, so I walk away and she gave me tickets for the entire grounds during the day time except for the visitor restricted palace, which I knew I could only get night tickets for after reading it on the monitors, which is why I tried to buy night tickets.Okay, lemons, make lemonade.

After looking at these reviews, I think that might be largely due to the fact that we planned well in advance. Here's a few tips to make your vacation visit a lot happier:1. You can actually call the Alhambra up and get tickets. They have at least 3 dedicated English speaking operators. Here's the phone number: Calling from North America 34- 934923750. You don't get tickets, but you do get an email confirmation. I was told to follow the regular instructions for picking up tickets: going to the ticket office at the Alhambra. Apparently, the credit card used to make the reservation is your identifier. I was also told to bring my passport, as well as the passport of my son, to verify age.2. We were allowed to pick up our tickets the afternoon before our visit. No standing in lines!3. If you don't want to climb that awful hill (15-20 minutes for a fit person), you can take the 30 bus from the center of town. We always caught it on the Gran Via del Colon (down from the Christopher Columbus statue). The stop is on the other side of the street from the marvelous ice cream place, Los Italianos. (so, get some ice cream before you hop on the bus. double bene, there. ) I think the fare was 80 cents.4. Everyone has a different schedule, but I would try for the 8:30 am slot for your reservation. Then, if you can, arrive by 8 am when it is beautifully quiet. There is a little wooden kiosk in front of the Alcazar that is open by 8, and they serve unbelievably good coffee for 1 euro. They also serve ham or salami (and a few more choices) baguettes for 3 euros. Throw some crumbs to the street cats.5. Hide in the middle of the day. I only saw 2 places to do this: this first is the restaurant of the Hotel America. From the outside, it doesn't look like it, but there is a vine-covered courtyard restaurant that is open to the public. (They are also open for breakfast at 8 am, but not sure of prices). The other is the cafeteria for the Parador. Go down the side entrance, down the steps. Before you go down, you will have a chance to look at the menu on the wall (and the prices). Some prices are heart attack inducing; others, not so bad. (I didn't go for the $10 ice cream). At the bottom of the stairs, go through the pricey restaurant, and turn left onto the outdoor, casual restaurant. It's shady and, I believe, also has misters. You have wonderful views over the Generalife, and gardens at your feet. In the evening, you will be able to hear the Generalife concerts wafting your way. And finally, if you are there before mid-October, 2012, you are in for a treat. Inside the Carlos V Palace there is a Sorolla art exhibit. If you like the French Impressionists, you will LOVE, LOVE this exhibit, particularly the paintings of the Alhambra and Granada.

If in or around Granada it is a not-to-be-missed attraction. We enjoyed walking though the myriad corridors and rooms and listening to the history of the rulers of yesteryears. The interiors are fascinating in some places. The hills offer a partial view of the city and it is difficult to stop gazing at the Sierra Nevada from here. The palace is itself breathtaking from the outside.Having said this, I find it a bit over-rated. The Alhambra is a splendid monument, but, I would not travel all the way to Granada to see it (again). There are several reasons for this: the monument itself could be restored; several parts of it seem to be in ruins. There is a creepiness in the whole area (thankfully there were a lot of people and so, we didnt feel afraid!) May be if some period furniture is added (perhaps from the museum) and some paintings/pictures of the kinds and queens are hung up, it will render a more lively look to the whole place. The Generalife gardens especially, are not really worth the effort of walking and climbing... perhaps we could not see it in all its glory in February, or perhaps we were just tired after the long walks in the Nasrid palace, I dont know... I also found some places to be quite bland... like much ado about nothing. Last but not the least, I am really surprised that this monument is rated as the most-visited/best one in Spain...

Another “wow!” moment on our trip. It is now the one of the leading tourist attractions in Spain, with 8000 visitors a day. It is another of many UNESCO World Heritage Sites we have seen on this trip. Rather obviously, it is the inspiration for Washington Irving’s Tales of the Alhambra, written by him while he was ambassador to Spain.Alhambra is a city of palaces. Literally, it means “the red fortress,” a name from the red color of the clay on many of the palace walls. The first of the Moorish palaces of Alhambra were started in 1238 by the Berber rulers in al-Andalus. Separate palaces were built for the last Muslim Emirs in Spain. The various palaces were occupied by Nasrid princes and their 4 wives and their harems. Although some were destroyed during the Napoleonic wars (by Napoleon’s brother), what remains are glorious to see. After the reconquest by the Catholic monarchs in 1492, the Palace of Charles V (the Holy Roman Emperor) was built in 1527 and inserted into the Alhambra in one of the Muslim palaces.We meet our local guide and start our tour in the rain. As she says, “Vamonos!” And, luckily, thanks to Alice and Dora, I know what she means. As beautiful as this place is, we can only imagine how striking it would be on a sunny day. The first part of the tour is through the gardens, with cedar trees in hedges pruned to look like a castle wall. There are wildflowers and roses, orange trees and myrtles, and hundreds of English elm trees. The sound of running water is everywhere, and not just from the rain. There are fountains and cascades and natural flowing water that has flowed into this area from high in the mountains for hundreds of years. We learn about the importance of the three elements – water, vegetation and light and they are present everywhere. Remember that the Islamic faith requires praying 5 times a day and before each prayer they must wash their hands, face and feet so water for these ablutions is crucial. Interestingly, in responding to a question, the guide was not aware of the Plague hitting Spain when it devastated much of Europe. One can only wonder if this constant cleansing helped control diseases. The outside of the Moorish buildings are plain and unimpressive. In the Arabic style, the beauty lies within the buildings.  Now we move to the most striking of the palaces. Vamonos. We enter into the Palace of the Nasrids, constructed around two courtyards – the Court of the Myrtles and the Court of the Lions. Muhammad V, constructed the Court of the Lions and it demonstrates his passion for embracing all cultures. The center is a fountain of 12 lions, a gift to him from the Jewish community nearby. It is said that the 12 lions represent the 12 tribes of Israel, although guidebooks also suggest they could represent the 12 months of the year, or the 12 signs of the zodiac. Although Muslims do not allow depictions of people and animals inside their buildings, he accepted the gift and made it the centerpiece of this courtyard. As we look around at the 128 columns that you might find in a Catholic Church and the fountain and the Arabic decorations, it truly shows a marriage of three cultures. Muhammad wanted to demonstrate that we could all live in peace and harmony with each other.We move into the Hall of the Ambassadors and learn that this is the very room where Columbus met with Queen Isabella and convinced her to finance his voyage to reach India by sailing west. Wow. Inside this very room. We also see the repeated Arabic phase, “only God is conqueror” which was adopted by Muhammad V as part of his royal crest. The palace buildings are rectangular with all of the rooms opening onto a central courtyard open to the sky. Rooms lead into other rooms, and then into other courtyards. So we are constantly walking from inside buildings where we are protected from the rain, back out to the courtyards that are beautiful to see. As each new section was added, there was a consistent theme of column arcades, Arabic inscriptions, geometrical patterns, ceramic tiles and horseshoe arches. The original colors of blue, red and yellow have faded over the centuries, but can be seen in some rooms. Sun and wind are freely admitted throughout.After the Christian conquest in 1492, many buildings were whitewashed and Charles V built a Renaissance-style structure that was never completed. There was a very interesting contrast between the two styles, with much more emphasis on the outside decorations for the Christian building. The Christian palace was never finished and the dome which normally would be above it was never constructed. Many of the bas relief locations are empty.

Sit in the shade and watch the entrance queue disappear within minutes and then stroll in. But don't be too relaxed it will take 20 mins to get from the entrance to the Nazarid palaces with small children.It will get hot, but there are plenty of places in the Alhambra to buy water and food, so there is no need to go in loaded like a camel, unless you don't want to spend 1,20 euro on a bottle of water.You are only allowed to enter The Nazarid palaces, Alcazaba and parts of the Generalife once.

We only had about 30 hours in Granada, so I booked three visits to the Alhambra during that time. Be sure to book in advance on the website. It was very easy. -- We easily walked across the street to the main ticket office of the Alhambra from the Hotel Guadalupe to get the tickets we had booked in advance. The first time we entered the Alhambra, it was about 4:00, so there was no line to pick up tickets. We purchased the audio guide, but I would not recommend it. I found it distracting rather than enhancing. It was enough to view what was there. Our entry into the Nasrid Palace was at 5:30, so we had time for a quick walk in the Generalife Gardens first. It was early July, so the flowers were past their prime because of the heat. -- Be in line for the Palaces so you can enter at the specified time. They are strict about that. Allow time to walk between sights. It was about a 20 minute walk from the gardens to the palaces. -- The Nasrid Palace was magnificent. After visiting the Nasrid Palace, we visited the fortress (the Alcazaba). I enjoyed the Palace much more than the military fortress. -- The Alhambra was closing, so we walked back to our hotel for a quick dinner, then back to the Alhambra for a night visit. We entered the main gates and walked toward the palaces. The palace entry for the night visit is not the same place as for the day visit. We entered behind the Carlos V Palace. We could not line up until right at 10 PM, when we were scheduled to enter. One large room with a white dome in the palace looked much more spectacular lit at night than in the daylight. But other parts were harder to see at night. So, I would say that a night viewing is necessary, but not sufficient for a visit to the Alhambra. -- There was a concert in the Carlos V Palace, so there were many people walking around the area. After we finished our night visit of the Palace, we had to exit onto the street near the palace, not go back to the main gate (it was closed). -- We visited the Alhambra again the next morning (with 12:00 entry into the Nasrid Palace). It was very interesting seeing everything in different lights. I’d highly recommend this. -- Since we had so little time in Granada, we concentrated on the Alhambra, but I would like to go back to Granada and see the other parts of the city.",822,"Huge.

Check opening times as they are a bit odd as it is run by volunteers.I hope you enjoy your visit and this will help you get the best out of it."

After reading about some of the experiences other travelers had encountered at the entrance to the Alhambra, I thought we were prepared. We prepurchased our tickets online (we had heard about the wait to buy tickets at the entrance could be hours long). However, I lost the credit card used for the purchase early during our trip.We were staying in Cordoba and took the only train to Granada late in the morning. We arrived by taxi to the Alahambra entrance 45 minutes before the entry time on our tickets. I had the confirmation page printed and also a copy of the lost credit card. The day was extremely hot (106 degree F). There were two lines. One for the ticket purchasers and one for the 'pickups' . We got in the pick-up line which was short, the other line was awful. The guard supervising the lines was barking questions in spanish to both lines. When tourist, who didn't speak spanish, tried to communicate with him, he made fun of them in spanish. My daughter is fluent and she translated that he was telling them they were stupid and to just go home. We were finally allowed to a ticket window 15 minutes before our 'entry time' to the palace. They found our tickets and gave quick instructions in spanish. One of my daughters had a sprained ankle. We had to walk very slowly. What we were not told was that it is a 20 minutes walk to the Palace and if you arrive after your entry time, they do not allow you in. It took us 30 minutes to walk to the Palace across the large park. We were lucky that the woman manning the entrance took pity on my injured daughter and let us in. Otherwise, we would have been out of luck.So here is the thing. It is VERY IMPORTANT that tourist understand that their ENTRY TIME is for the Palace and not for the general Alhambra. You really should enter the first general entrance at least 30 minutes prior to the 'Entry time"". You have to walk at least 20 minutes past the general entrance to the entrance for the Palace. THIS IS VERY CONFUSING AND NOT CLEAR. The Palace was lovely and interesting. But honestly, if you consider the stress in dealing with the Alhambra procedures and the cost.....I would have been happy to just see the Mosque of cordoba instead. If you do decide to brave the system of the Alhambra, do the following.1. Plan to do on a day that is not hot. Otherwise, you won't enjoy the massive outdoor gardens.2. Do NOT LOSE YOUR CREDIT CARD (then you can just pull your tickets from an ATM machine at the Alhambra.)3.

It was built in 1238 by Muhammad Ibn el-Ahmar to be a formidable fortification on Sabika hill, opposite Albaicin, which was the heart of Muslim Granada. (The name Granada means pomegranate.)(A brief history of the Moorish occupation of Spain- In 711 AD some rulers from the Visigoth tribe in Spain journeyed to Africa to seek help with some domestic &amp; political problems. They returned with an army of 7,000 Moors, who quickly took over all but a small strip of northern Spain, starting with the victory over Cadiz.They never demanded religious conversions, as long as Christians paid taxes. In 744 AD resistance against these invaders spread south from the unoccupied northern territory. El Cid succeeded in capturing Toledo in 1085. A coalition of Christian armies was finally victorious at the Battle of Navas de Tolosa in 1212. After 500 years of occupation, the Moors were banished, but left important legacies like mathematics, papermaking, oranges, spices, bathing, and rice.) This site continued to be developed throughout the 13th and 14th centuries by Yusuf I and Muhammad V. Walls, towers, mosques, palaces and gardens were added to the emormous military and residential complexes.In the 15th Century the Nasrid dynasty fell into decline, and Christians reclaimed the city. Catholic monarchs started minor modifications, but the fort/palace fell into ruin, until it was rediscovered by artists and travelers in the 19th century, and fully restored to the current condition. Our tour guide Lucy Valentine, from ""Go Granada""(highy recommend), told us that some of the rediscovery of this area was because of the attention from the literary world via Washington Irving's book, ""Tales of the Alhambra"", ""a series of tales and sketches of the Moors and Spaniards.Some of the areas you will visit are- the Palacio de Carlos V and it's museums/ the Alcazaba/ the Casa Real, Mexuar and Palacio de Comares/the Partal and towers/ the Generalife( summer palace set in 75 acries of gardens and orchards)/ and the Palacio de los Leones, the royal family's private quarters, surrounded by a gallery of 124 marble columns, miniature canals, fountains, and the courtyard of the lions. Unfortunately, my beautiful memory of seeing this courtyard in 1964, when I was in high school, was dampened when we approached this area, and saw that it is under a huge rennovation project, and everything was covered with plastic, with workers everywhere. That was the only disappointing moment of my reminisant journey back to the Alhambra, 48 years later.As others have mentioned, be sure to purchase your tickets ahead of time on-line.

Its unfortunate that parts of it are falling into disrepair, and that so little is done to prevent people from touching the plaster, destroying it bit by bit.

The various courtyards and gardens are also nice to visit. If not for the number of tourists walking around, I can imagine it to be a very peaceful, pleasant place to visit. However, the number of visitors around me really reduced the experience to that of following the crowd along the way to see building full of people inside. The management has put in place crowd control measures to ensure only a fixed number of people visit the place at a fixed timing, but I still feel it's a little too many people.Other than this, I think it's still a pretty nice place to visit while you are in Granada albeit its pretty touristy nature.

Millions of people visit it every year. The 3 couples in our party almost didn't stop here due to the difficulty of visiting (unable to visit Nazaries Palace unless you reserve tickets in advance for your ""alloted"" time) and the sheer size of this sight. In the end, we couldn't deny the fact this was the top sight to visit. So we did and without advance reservations.As part of our 14 day driving trip through Spain and France we really did not know when we would arrive in Granada. After getting there we spent the night in a nearby hotel. Around 8:30am the next morning we took the local city bus to the Alhambra bus arriving around 9am at the ticket office. On this particular day we were able to get a 1pm entrance to Nazaries Palace (of course had to be at the Nazaries Palace entrance 30 minutes ahead). Now that we have been to Alhambra we all highly recommend a visit. We actually enjoyed the fortress the best (even over the palace). There are multiple levels to the fortress and grounds. Views overlooking Granada from the fortress are just outstanding. King Charles V Palace is simple and a good place to get out of the occasional rain storm like we had the day of our visit. Nazaries Palace has exquisite detailed ornamentation, yet lacks any furnishings.

Alhambra is the #1 tourist sight in all of Spain. Millions of people visit it every year. The 3 couples in our party almost didn't stop here due to the difficulty of visiting (unable to visit Nazaries Palace unless you reserve tickets in advance for your ""alloted"" time) and the sheer size of this sight. In the end, we couldn't deny the fact this was the top sight to visit. So we did and without advance reservations.As part of our 14 day driving trip through Spain and France we really did not know when we would arrive in Granada. After getting there we spent the night in a nearby hotel. Around 8:30am the next morning we took the local city bus to the Alhambra bus arriving around 9am at the ticket office. On this particular day we were able to get a 1pm entrance to Nazaries Palace (of course had to be at the Nazaries Palace entrance 30 minutes ahead). Now that we have been to Alhambra we all highly recommend a visit. We actually enjoyed the fortress the best (even over the palace). There are multiple levels to the fortress and grounds. Views overlooking Granada from the fortress are just outstanding. King Charles V Palace is simple and a good place to get out of the occasional rain storm like we had the day of our visit. Nazaries Palace has exquisite detailed ornamentation, yet lacks any furnishings. The lion sculptures from the famous fountain are being restored in a separate area and the fountain area is currently under construction. Be sure to peek out of the windows from the palace to view quaint gardens. We did not take the audio handsets but I would think you could get more from your visit if you did.

If you are in the area do go and see.Be advised though, that it is essential to book your tickets in advance. You can do this by 'phone or online. There is also a very well laid out website to visit.Whether you go in the morning or the afternoon, you must get your tickets well in advance. The queue is horrendous, but you are moved swiftly through.The Car Park is quite expensive, so make sure you have an idea how much you will need to feed the machine when you leave. A Tip - you have ten minutes to get out after you have paid and validated your ticket. Do what we did, go back to your car, have a drink and a bit if a rest then go and validate your ticket. Do beforehand, get your audio headphones (fee payable) this makes all make sense as you are walking around. Alternatively you can go on a guided tour - see website.This is a huge site, with a lot of steps, so can be a tiring day.The main entrance is at the bottom of the car park. If you arrive at least a couple of hours early you can take a left turn at the information desk, round down the to the bottom of the hill and visit the Palace Carlos V. The Justice Gate is at the bottom of the hill, go through that and visit the Gardens, the Souvenir Shops should you wish. Carlos V Palace is to your left, a huge building, go in , you will be surprised............. There are gardens to wonder through, quiet area's to sit and contemplate in, and the birds come down to see if there are any small offerings for them - they like dried fruit!!!. There is also a Spanish Parador set in lovely gardens you can look at (there are paying guest there).Be sure to be back at the main entrance at least half an hour before your entrance time.

As others have said, the entry time means when you can enter the Nasrid Palace, and if you miss your half hour slot you won't be allowed in.We arrived around 11.00, parked and picked up our tickets at the machines - no queues at all. Outside the main gate there were fairly long queues for that day's tickets and while we were waiting outside they announced that the morning's tickets had sold out.Here's the best tip. When you buy a ticket for the afternoon you're only allowed to enter through the main gates from just before 2.30. However, if you walk round to the left and down the road for 10 minutes (or you can jump on the 32 shuttle bus) you can enter at any time through the gate at the Puerta de la Justica. This allows you into the Palace complex where you can buy drinks but no food - recommend you take sandwiches if you want to eat - and visit the Palacio de Carlos V while you wait for your slot. From 2.00 (if you have an afternoon ticket) you are allowed into the Alcazaba or the Generalife gardens, although they're at the other end so best done last if you're parked in the main car parks.The visit itself was very enjoyable and some of the architecture and views are stunning.",915,"Plan in advance and you'll be fine.

First of all, I was directed OUT of the place after getting my pass, which comes after already purchasing a ticket to avoid the queues by buying two city passes for 72 Euros!! No-one seems to have any idea how to control and direct the visitors, there are no guides given at the enterance and it seemed chaotic.

On our return we were waylaid by a group of gypsies who thrust heather (grown in abundance along the road access to the Alhambra) into my hand and then tried to snatch hold of my purse. They got so aggressive that they shoved me into the guttering at the side of the access road. These gypsies hang around with the guards and seem to have permission to be there even though they swarm towards any visitors arriving and literally block your pathThe place itself has a ridiculous amount of checks to go through - after the first ticket check the long line of people were made to wait again and have the tickets scanned, as the sun beats downThis is not an attraction I would recommend to anyone who tires, has any health issues or small children - it was myself and my healthy teen son and we were sweltering and uncomfortable with the long waitsAfter all that there were some nice views and impressive gardens and the castle like building but it is rustic, not palacial as I expected.

(If you arrive late to the palace by more than 10 minutes, you will not be admitted). But the advantage to being first into the palace was unhindered views and great photos. The tour groups came a little later, and could really cause a jam if you got stuck behind them. If you want to rent an audioguide, stop at the Charles V Palace first; they are not available at the Nasrid palace. The only restrooms at this enormous place were near the Alcazar and at the ticket offices, nowhere else. There are some water fountains scattered around, but I recommend you also bring some water, as it can get warm, and the walking is difficult on the cobblestones and many stairs. The gardens were very beautiful in April, and we spent time resting on the benches just enjoying the beauty. The Alhambra is amazing, and there is much to see.

Despite multilingual staff on all counters, nobody had infomed us that we only had ten minutes to get to the palace as they only allow a set number in every hour. The walk to the palace takes guess what...ten minutes, so if you stop to look at the beatiful gardens, art gallery, museum and church along the way then you will miss your time slot. Needless to say we were turned away from the palace by an incredibly rude and unsympathetic warden, who took great enjoyment in telling us ""those are the rules"".The tickets we bought did quote a time which was in ten minutes from purchase, and in really small print on the back of the ticket it stated that if we missed our slot then we would have to buy another ticket!!!Surely not. So two of us swiftly walk back to the ticket office (10mins) to try and get issued with new ones. When we arrived we found an American couple complaining of exactly the same treatment, to which the response ""we even write it in English for you!"" ""can you not read"". We noted that whilst arguing with the customer service lady that the cashiers were in fact advising Spanish visitors of the time conditions of entry into the palace, but amazingly when an English speaking tourist purchased a ticket they said nothing. This I hasten to add was nothing to do with the language barrier, as both cashiers we spoke to spoke better Queens English than ourselves.We had travelled 300 kms to visit the palace so naturally we paid again, a great little money spinner I think. Incidentally those with pushchairs or wheelchairs are not catered for despite the big shiny ramp at the entrance. Once inside the palace its all steps up and down, which with a baby is hard work, but for a wheelchair near on impossible.However, the palace is magnificent and I would highly recommend a visit, just watch out for the small print and acid staff.",925,"Fabulous place the worst attitude.

So two of us swiftly walk back to the ticket office (10mins) to try and get issued with new ones. When we arrived we found an American couple complaining of exactly the same treatment, to which the response ""we even write it in English for you!"" ""can you not read"". We noted that whilst arguing with the customer service lady that the cashiers were in fact advising Spanish visitors of the time conditions of entry into the palace, but amazingly when an English speaking tourist purchased a ticket they said nothing. This I hasten to add was nothing to do with the language barrier, as both cashiers we spoke to spoke better Queens English than ourselves.We had travelled 300 kms to visit the palace so naturally we paid again, a great little money spinner I think. Incidentally those with pushchairs or wheelchairs are not catered for despite the big shiny ramp at the entrance. Once inside the palace its all steps up and down, which with a baby is hard work, but for a wheelchair near on impossible.However, the palace is magnificent and I would highly recommend a visit, just watch out for the small print and acid staff."

It is fantastic absolutely not to be missed. Booked ahead online which was definitiely worth it, when we arrived at 10am there were still tickets on sale but when we left at 2pm there were none. We arrived at 10am for our 12pm time slot in the Nasrid palaces which was just about right since there is a lot of the complex to see before the palaces themselves. We drove to Granada, the alhambra is very well signposted and there are three large carparks right outside the complex - again arriving in the morning meant that we had the pick of parking spaces. You pay when you leave and should make sure that you have around 15 euros in notes - this is the maximum charge for if you stay all day otherwise it is by the hour and the machines give change. We used the audio guides which were good and well worth the money. You do need to have your passport with you to collect the tickets and to leave as a surety for the audio guides (they also take a driving licence or credit card}. Foodwise we bought water and sandwiches from the coffee kiosk next to the complex - there are some vending machines inside and a two coffee kiosks which are OK but limited. Strongly advise that you take your own food with you.",925,"Fantastic - unmissable. Visited the Alhambra in the last week in March 2006. It is fantastic absolutely not to be missed.

But if you've been during the day - don't bother with the Night time visit. While it's quieter, the lighting is very poor and you don't get to see all the areas you would during the day visit. E10 better spent elsewhere. Try it on extra tapas in one of the many excellent bars in town",926,"Night time - not worth it. Daytime visit to L'Alhambra is truly amazing.
